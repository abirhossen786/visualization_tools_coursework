ID EFFECTS MODELS
AB Learning Pulse explores whether using a machine learning approach on multimodal data such as heart rate, step count, weather condition and learning activity can be used to predict learning performance in self-regulated learning settings. An experiment was carried out lasting eight weeks involving PhD students as participants, each of them wearing a Fitbit HR wristband and having their application on their computer recorded during their learning and working activities throughout the day. A software infrastructure for collecting multimodal learning experiences was implemented. As part of this infrastructure a Data Processing Application was developed to pre-process, analyse and generate predictions to provide feedback to the users about their learning performance. Data from different sources were stored using the xAPI standard into a cloud-based Learning Record Store. The participants of the experiment were asked to rate their learning experience through an Activity Rating Tool indicating their perceived level of productivity, stress, challenge and abilities. These self-reported performance indicators were used as markers to train a Linear Mixed Effect Model to generate learner-specific predictions of the learning performance. We discuss the advantages and the limitations of the used approach, highlighting further development points.

AB In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm to train neural network, called Class-Constrained Extreme Learning Machine ((CELM)-E-2), which is based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In (CELM)-E-2, we use class information to constrain different parts of connection weights between input layer and hidden layer using Extreme Learning Machine Auto Encoder (ELM-AE). In this way, we add class information to the connection weights and make the features in the hidden layer which are learned from input space be more discriminative than other methods based on ELM. Meanwhile, (CELM)-E-2 can retain the advantages of ELM. The experiments shown that (CELM)-E-2 is effective and efficient and can achieve a higher performance in contrast to other ELM based methods.

ID ALGORITHM
AB A novel online sequential extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm with regularization mechanism in a unified framework is proposed in this paper. This algorithm is called timeliness online regularized extreme learning machine (TORELM). Like the timeliness managing extreme learning machine (TMELM) which incorporates timeliness management scheme into ELM approach for the incremental samples, TORELM also processes data one-by-one or chunk-by-chunk under the similar framework, while the newly incremental data could be prior to the historical data by maximizing the contribution of the newly increasing training data. Furthermore, in consideration of the disproportion between empirical risk and structural risk in some traditional learning methods, we add regularization technique to the timeliness scheme of TORELM through the use of a weight factor to balance them to achieve better generalization performance. Therefore, TORELM may has its unique feature of higher generalization capability with a small testing error while implementing online sequential learning. And the simulation results show that TORELM performs better than other ELM algorithms.

AB Recently, Machine Learning has achieved impressive results, surpassing human performances, but these powerful algorithms are still unable to define their goals by themselves or to adapt when the task changes. In short, they are not autonomous. In this paper, we explain why autonomy is an important criterion for really powerful learning algorithms. We propose a number of characteristics that make humans more autonomous than machines when they learn. Humans have a system of memories where one memory can compensate or train another memory if needed. They are able to detect uncertainties and adapt accordingly. They are able to define their goals by themselves, from internal and external cues and are capable of self-evaluation to adapt their learning behavior. We also suggest that introducing these characteristics in the domain of Machine Learning is a critical challenge for future intelligent systems.

AB This Volume is a result of workshop 15w2181 "Advances in interactive knowledge discovery and data mining in complex and big data sets" at the Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery. The workshop was dedicated to bring together experts with diverse backgrounds but with one common goal: to understand intelligence for the successful design, development and evaluation of algorithms that can learn from data, extract knowledge from experience, and to improve their learning behaviour over time - similarly as we humans do. Knowledge discovery, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence are more or less synonymously used with no strict definitions or boundaries. "Integrative" means to support not only the machine learning & knowledge extraction pipeline, ranging from dealing with data in arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces to the visualization of results into a lower dimension accessible to a human; it is taking into account seemingly disparate fields which can be very fruitful when brought together for solving problems in complex application domains (e.g. health informatics). Here we want to emphasize that the most important findings in machine learning will be those we do not know yet. In this paper we provide: (1) a short motivation for the integrative approach; (2) brief summaries of the presentations given in Banff; and (3) some personally flavoured, subjective future research outlooks, e.g. in the combination of geometrical approaches with machine learning.

In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning model based on ensemble learning, feature method pairs and multi-view learning concepts. This model targets learning problems with multiple factors or facets. Using botnet detection as an example multi-faceted learning problem, we explain the desirable properties this model promises. The aim of the model is to provide a guideline for designing machine learning based solutions for a specific type of learning problem.

AB Background: As more and more researchers are turning to big data for new opportunities of biomedical discoveries, machine learning models, as the backbone of big data analysis, are mentioned more often in biomedical journals. However, owing to the inherent complexity of machine learning methods, they are prone to misuse. Because of the flexibility in specifying machine learning models, the results are often insufficiently reported in research articles, hindering reliable assessment of model validity and consistent interpretation of model outputs.
   Objective: To attain a set of guidelines on the use of machine learning predictive models within clinical settings to make sure the models are correctly applied and sufficiently reported so that true discoveries can be distinguished from random coincidence.
   Methods: A multidisciplinary panel of machine learning experts, clinicians, and traditional statisticians were interviewed, using an iterative process in accordance with the Delphi method.
   Results: The process produced a set of guidelines that consists of (1) a list of reporting items to be included in a research article and (2) a set of practical sequential steps for developing predictive models.
   Conclusions: A set of guidelines was generated to enable correct application of machine learning models and consistent reporting of model specifications and results in biomedical research. We believe that such guidelines will accelerate the adoption of big data analysis, particularly with machine learning methods, in the biomedical research community.

ID ERRORS
AB Static program analysis is a technique to analyse code without executing it, and can be used to find bugs in source code. Many open source and commercial tools have been developed in this space over the past 20 years. Scalability and precision are of importance for the deployment of static code analysis tools numerous false positives and slow runtime both make the tool hard to be used by development, where integration into a nightly build is the standard goal. This requires one to identify a suitable abstraction for the static analysis which is typically a manual process and can be expensive.
   In this paper we report our findings on using machine learning techniques to detect defects in C programs. We use three off-the- shelf machine learning techniques and use a large corpus of programs available for use in both the training and evaluation of the results. We compare the results produced by the machine learning technique against the Parfait static program analysis tool used internally at Oracle by thousands of developers.
   While on the surface the initial results were encouraging, further investigation suggests that the machine learning techniques we used are not suitable replacements for static program analysis tools due to low precision of the results. This could be due to a variety of reasons including not using domain knowledge such as the semantics of the programming language and lack of suitable data used in the training process.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB The relationship between statistical dependency and causality lies at the heart of all statistical approaches to causal inference. Recent results in the ChaLearn cause-effect pair challenge have shown that causal directionality can be inferred with good accuracy also in Markov indistinguishable configurations thanks to data driven approaches. This paper proposes a supervised machine learning approach to infer the existence of a directed causal link between two variables in multivariate settings with n > 2 variables. The approach relies on the asymmetry of some conditional (in) dependence relations between the members of the Markov blankets of two variables causally connected. Our results show that supervised learning methods may be successfully used to extract causal information on the basis of asymmetric statistical descriptors also for n > 2 variate distributions.

AB Machine learning is an area of computer science in which the computer predicts the next task to perform by analyzing the data provided to it. The data accessed by the computer can be in the form of digitized training sets or via interaction with the environment. The algorithms of machine learning are constructed in such a way as to learn and make predictions from the data unlike the static programming algorithms that need explicit human instruction. There have been different supervised and unsupervised techniques proposed in order to solve problems, such as, Rule-based techniques, Logic-based techniques, Instance-based techniques, stochastic techniques. The primary objective of our paper is to provide a general comparison among various state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms.

AB Recent technological advances in the fields of biology and medicine allow measuring single cells into unprecedented depth. This results in new types of high-throughput datasets that shed new lights on cell development, both in healthy as well as diseased tissues. However, studying these biological processes into greater detail crucially depends on novel computational techniques that efficiently mine single cell data sets. In this paper, we introduce machine learning techniques for single cell data analysis: we summarize the main developments in the field, and highlight a number of interesting new avenues that will likely stimulate the design of new types of machine learning algorithms.

AB An appearance-based robot self-localization problem is considered in the machine learning framework. The appearance space is composed of all possible images, which can be captured by a robot's visual system under all robot localizations. Using recent manifold learning and deep learning techniques, we propose a new geometrically motivated solution based on training data consisting of a finite set of images captured in known locations of the robot. The solution includes estimation of the robot localization mapping from the appearance space to the robot localization space, as well as estimation of the inverse mapping for modeling visual image features. The latter allows solving the robot localization problem as the Kalman filtering problem.

AB Learning Analytics (LA) has a major interest in exploring and understanding the learning process of humans and, for this purpose, benefits from both Cognitive Science, which studies how humans learn, and Machine Learning, which studies how algorithms learn from data. Usually, Machine Learning is exploited as a tool for analyzing data coming from experimental studies, but it has been recently applied to humans as if they were algorithms that learn from data. One example is the application of Rademacher Complexity, which measures the capacity of a learning machine, to human learning, which led to the formulation of Human Rademacher Complexity (HRC). In this line of research, we propose here a more powerful measure of complexity, the Human Algorithmic Stability (HAS), as a tool to better understand the learning process of humans. The experimental results from three different empirical studies, on more than 600 engineering students from the University of Genoa, showed that HAS (i) can be measured without the assumptions required by HRC, (ii) depends not only on the knowledge domain, as HRC, but also on the complexity of the problem, and (iii) can be exploited for better understanding of the human learning process.

AB In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning algorithm for online training. The proposed algorithm, which is called Online Transfer Extreme Learning Machine (OTELM), is based on Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OSELM) while it introduces Semi-Supervised Extreme Learning Machine (SSELM) to transfer knowledge from the source to the target domain. With the manifold regularization, SSELM picks out instances from the source domain that are less relevant to those in the target domain to initialize the online training, so as to improve the classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed OTELM can effectively use instances in the source domain to enhance the learning performance.

With the growing amount of data being generated by global data sources (e.g., social media and mobile apps) and the popularization of context-specific data (e.g., the Internet of Things), companies and researchers need to connect all these data and extract valuable information. Machine learning has been gaining much attention in data mining, leveraging the birth of new solutions. This paper proposes an architecture to create a flexible and scalable machine learning as a service. An open source solution was implemented and presented. As a case study, a forecast of electricity demand was generated using real-world sensor and weather data by running different algorithms at the same time.

AB The increasing popularity of social media in recent years has created new opportunities to study and evaluate public opinions and sentiments for use in marketing and social behavioural studies. However, binary classification into positive and negative sentiments may not reveal too much information about a product or service. This research paper explores the multi-class sentiment classification using machine learning methods. Three machine learning methods are investigated in this paper to examine their respective performance in multi-class sentiment classification of tweets. Experimental results show that Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) achieves better performance than other machine learning methods.

AB The rapid growth of Web usage for advertising job positions provides a great opportunity for real-time labour market monitoring. This is the aim of Labour Market Intelligence (LMI), a field that is becoming increasingly relevant to EU Labour Market policies design and evaluation. The analysis of Web job vacancies, indeed, represents a competitive advantage to labour market stakeholders with respect to classical survey-based analyses, as it allows for reducing the time-to-market of the analysis by moving towards a fact-based decision making model. In this paper, we present our approach for automatically classifying million Web job vacancies on a standard taxonomy of occupations. We show how this problem has been expressed in terms of text classification via machine learning. Then, we provide details about the classification pipelines we evaluated and implemented, along with the outcomes of the validation activities. Finally, we discuss how machine learning contributed to the LMI needs of the European Organisation that supported the project.

AB This tutorial introduces Lifelong Machine Learning (LML) and Machine Reading. The core idea of LML is to learn continuously and accumulate the learned knowledge, and to use the knowledge to help future learning, which is perhaps the hallmark of human learning and human intelligence. By using prior knowledge seamlessly and effortlessly, we humans can learn without a lot of training data, but current machine learning algorithms tend to need a huge amount of training data. LML aims to mimic this human capability. Machine Reading is a research area with the goal of building systems to read natural language text. Among different approaches employed in Machine Reading, this tutorial focuses on projects and approaches that use the idea of LML.
   Most current machine learning (ML) algorithms learn in isolation. They are designed to address a specific problem using a single dataset. That is, given a dataset, an ML algorithm is executed on the dataset to build a model. Although this type of isolated learning is very useful, it does not have the ability to accumulate past knowledge and to make use of the knowledge for future learning, which we believe are critical for the future of machine learning and data mining LML aims to design and develop computational systems and algorithms with this capability, i.e., to learn as humans do in a lifelong manner.
   In this tutorial, we introduce this important problem and the existing LML techniques and discuss opportunities and challenges of big data for lifelong machine learning. We also want to motivate researchers and practitioners to actively explore LML as the big data provides us a golden opportunity to learn a large volume of diverse knowledge, to connect different pieces of it, and to use it to raise data mining and machine learning to a new level.

AB Determination of model complexity is a challenging issue to solve computer vision problems using restricted boltzmann machines (RBMs). Many algorithms for feature learning depend on cross-validation or empirical methods to optimize the number of features. In this work, we propose an learning algorithm to find the optimal model complexity for the RBMs by incrementing the hidden layer. The proposed algorithm is composed of two processes: 1) determining incrementation necessity of neurons and 2) computing the number of additional features for the increment. Specifically, the proposed algorithm uses a normalized reconstruction error in order to determine incrementation necessity and prevent unnecessary increment for the number of features during training. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal number of features in a single layer RBMs. In the classification results, our model could outperform the non-incremental RBM.

AB Smart algorithms are used in Machine vision and Robotics to organize or extract high-level information from the available data. Nowadays, Machine learning is an essential and ubiquitous tool to automate extraction patterns or regularities from data (images in Machine vision; camera, laser, and sonar sensors data in Robotics) in order to solve various subject-oriented tasks such as understanding and classification of images content, navigation of mobile autonomous robot in uncertain environments, robot manipulation in medical robotics and computer-assisted surgery, and other. Usually such data have high dimensionality, however, due to various dependencies between their components and constraints caused by physical reasons, all 'feasible and usable data' occupy only a very small part in high dimensional 'observation space' with smaller intrinsic dimensionality. Generally accepted model of such data is manifold model in accordance with which the data lie on or near an unknown manifold (surface) of lower dimensionality embedded in an ambient high dimensional observation space; real-world high-dimensional data obtained from 'natural' sources meet, as a rule, this model. The use of Manifold learning technique in Machine vision and Robotics, which discovers a low-dimensional structure of high dimensional data and results in effective algorithms for solving of a large number of various subject-oriented tasks, is the content of the conference plenary speech some topics of which are in the paper.

AB In this paper, a multi-layer online sequential extreme learning machine (ML-OSELM) is proposed for image classification. ML-OSELM is an online sequential version of a recently proposed multi-layer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) method for batch learning. Existing ELM-based sequential learning methods, such as state-of-the-art online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM), were proposed only for single-hidden-layer networks. A distinctive feature of the new method is that it can sequentially train a multi-hidden-layer ELM network. Auto-encoders are used to performlayer-by-layer unsupervised sequential learning in ML-OSELM. We used four image classification datasets in our experiments and ML-OSELM performs better than the OS-ELM method on all of them.

AB This paper presents an exploratory machine learning attack based on deep learning to infer the functionality of an arbitrary classifier by polling it as a black box, and using returned labels to build a functionally equivalent machine. Typically, it is costly and time consuming to build a classifier, because this requires collecting training data (e.g., through crowdsourcing), selecting a suitable machine learning algorithm (through extensive tests and using domain-specific knowledge), and optimizing the underlying hyperparameters (applying a good understanding of the classifier's structure). In addition, all this information is typically proprietary and should be protected. With the proposed black-box attack approach, an adversary can use deep learning to reliably infer the necessary information by using labels previously obtained from the classifier under attack, and build a functionally equivalent machine learning classifier without knowing the type, structure or underlying parameters of the original classifier. Results for a text classification application demonstrate that deep learning can infer Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers with high accuracy and steal their functionalities. This new attack paradigm with deep learning introduces additional security challenges for online machine learning algorithms and raises the need for novel mitigation strategies to counteract the high fidelity inference capability of deep learning.

ID LANGUAGE; KERNELS; LOGIC
AB We introduce kProbLog as a declarative logical language for machine learning. kProbLog is a simple algebraic extension of Prolog with facts and rules annotated by semi-ring labels. It allows to elegantly combine algebraic expressions with logic programs. We introduce the semantics of kProbLog, its inference algorithm, its implementation and provide convergence guarantees. We provide several code examples to illustrate its potential for a wide range of machine learning techniques. In particular, we show the encodings of state-of-the-art graph kernels such as Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, propagation kernels and an instance of graph invariant kernels, a recent framework for graph kernels with continuous attributes. However, kProbLog is not limited to kernel methods and it can concisely express declarative formulations of tensor-based algorithms such as matrix factorization and energy-based models, and it can exploit semirings of dual numbers to perform algorithmic differentiation. Furthermore, experiments show that kProbLog is not only of theoretical interest, but can also be applied to real-world datasets. At the technical level, kProbLog extends aProbLog (an algebraic Prolog) by allowing multiple semirings to coexist in a single program and by introducing meta-functions for manipulating algebraic values.

AB Virtualization has gained tremendous traction as the go-to computing technology due to many advantages it offers such as server consolidation, increased reliability and availability, and enhanced security through isolation of virtual machines. Within a virtual machine itself, securing workloads against cyber attacks becomes an increasingly critical task. In this paper, we present the application of machine learning and anomaly detection to automatically detect malicious attacks on typical server workloads running on virtual machines. An integral aspect of the work is finding the right set of features that can be used to distinguish normal from malicious activity.

ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an efficient and effective learning algorithm for pattern classification. For binary classification problem, traditional ELM learns only one hyperplane to separate different classes in the feature space. In this paper, we propose a novel twin extreme learning machine (TELM) to simultaneously train two ELMs with two nonparallel classification hyperplanes. Specifically, TELM first utilizes the random feature mapping mechanism to construct the feature space, and then two nonparallel separating hyperplanes are learned for the final classification. For each hyperplane, TELM jointly minimizes its distance to one class and requires it to be far away from the other class. TELM incorporates the idea of twin support vector machine (TSVM) into the basic framework of ELM, thus TELM could have the advantages of the both algorithms. Moreover, compared to TSVM, TELM has fewer optimization constraint variables but with better classification performance. We also introduce a successive over-relaxation technique to speed up the training of our algorithm. Comprehensive experimental results on a large number of datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TELM. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have been attracted attention to prevent semiconductor counterfeits. However, the risk of machine learning attack for an arbiter PUF, which is one of the typical PUFs, has been reported. Therefore, an XOR arbiter PUF, which has a resistance against the machine learning attack, was proposed. However, in recent years, a new machine learning attack using power consumption during the operation of the PUF circuit was reported. Also, it is important that the detailed tamper resistance verification of the PUFs to consider the security of the PUFs in the future. Therefore, this study proposes a new machine learning attack using electromagnetic waveforms for the XOR arbiter PUF. Experiments by an actual device evaluate the validity of the proposed method and the security of the XOR arbiter PUF.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is not only an effective classifier but also a useful cluster. Unsupervised extreme learning machine (US-ELM) gives favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Extreme learning machine as an auto encoder (ELM-AE) can obtain principal components which represent original samples. The proposed unsupervised extreme learning machine based on embedded features of ELM-AE (US-EF-ELM) algorithm applies ELM-AE to US-ELM. US-EF-ELM regards embedded features of ELM-AE as the outputs of US-ELM hidden layer, and uses US-ELM to obtain the embedded matrix of US-ELM. US-EF-ELM can handle the multi-cluster clustering. The learning capability and computational efficiency of US-EF-ELM are as same as US-ELM. By experiments on UCI data sets, we compared US-EF-ELM k-means algorithm with k-means algorithm, spectral clustering algorithm, and US-ELM k-means algorithm in accuracy and efficiency.

ID DETECTION SYSTEMS; CLASSIFICATION
AB Network security has become a very important issue and attracted a lot of study and practice. To detect or prevent network attacks, a network intrusion detection (NID) system may be equipped with machine learning algorithms to achieve better accuracy and faster detection speed. One of the major advantages of applying machine learning to network intrusion detection is that we don't need expert knowledge as much as the black or white list model. In this paper, we apply the equality constrained-optimization-based extreme learning machine to network intrusion detection. An adaptively incremental learning strategy is proposed to derive the optimal number of hidden neurons. The optimization criteria and a way of adaptively increasing hidden neurons with binary search are developed. The proposed approach is applied to network intrusion detection to examine its capability. Experimental results show our proposed approach is effective in building models with good attack detection rates and fast learning speed.

AB Materials scientists are increasingly adopting the use of machine learning tools to discover hidden trends in data and make predictions. Applying concepts from data science without foreknowledge of their limitations and the unique qualities of materials data, however, could lead to errant conclusions. The differences that exist between various kinds of experimental and calculated data require careful choices of data processing and machine learning methods. Here, we outline potential pitfalls involved in using machine learning without robust protocols. We address some problems of overfitting to training data using decision trees as an example, rational descriptor selection in the field of perovskites, and preserving physical interpretability in the application of dimensionality reducing techniques such as principal component analysis. We show how proceeding without the guidance of domain knowledge can lead to both quantitatively and qualitatively incorrect predictive models.

AB Machine learning algorithms learn a desired input-output relation from examples in order to interpret new inputs. This is important for tasks such as image and speech recognition or strategy optimisation, with growing applications in the IT industry. In the last couple of years, researchers investigated if quantum computing can help to improve classical machine learning algorithms. Ideas range from running computationally costly algorithms or their subroutines efficiently on a quantum computer to the translation of stochastic methods into the language of quantum theory. This contribution gives a systematic overview of the emerging field of quantum machine learning. It presents the approaches as well as technical details in an accessible way, and discusses the potential of a future theory of quantum learning.

AB The original extreme learning machine (ELM) was designed for the balanced data, and it balanced misclassification cost of every sample to get the solution. Weighted extreme learning machine assumed that the balance can be achieved through the equality of misclassification costs. This paper improves previous weighted ELM with decay-weight matrix setting for balance and optimization learning. The decay-weight matrix is based on the sample number of each class, but the weight sum values of each class are not necessarily equal. When the number of samples is reduced, the weight sum is also reduced. By adjusting the decaying velocity, classifier could achieve more appropriate boundary position. From the experimental results, the decay-weighted ELM obtains the better effects in solving the imbalance classification tasks, particularly in multiclass tasks. This method was successfully applied to build the prediction model in the urban traffic congestion prediction system.

The type of treatment recommended for an individual is influenced by various factors such as cancer-type, the severity of cancer (stage) and most important the genetic heterogeneity. In such a complex environment, the targeted drug treatments are likely to be irresponsive or respond differently. To study anticancer drug response we need to understand cancerous profiles. These cancerous profiles carry information which can reveal the underlying factors responsible for cancer growth. Hence, there is need to analyze cancer data for predicting optimal treatment options. Analysis of such profiles can help to predict and discover potential drug targets and drugs. In this paper the main aim is to provide machine learning based classification technique for cancerous profiles.

DE radiation oncology; machine learning; waiting times
AB We describe a method for predicting waiting times in radiation oncology using machine learning. The patient waiting experience remains one of the most vexing challenges facing healthcare. At our comprehensive cancer centre, waiting periods that arise throughout a patient's course of treatment are generally difficult for staff to predict and only rough estimates are typically provided based on personal experience. To the patient, waiting times feel long and are seemingly unpredictable. Delays for treatment at our centre depend on the durations of preceding patients scheduled in the queue. To that end, we have incorporated the treatment records of all previously-treated patients into a machine learning framework in order to predict treatment durations to infer an overall waiting time. We found that the Random Forest Regression model provides the best predictions for daily fractionated radiotherapy treatment durations. Using this model, we achieved a median residual (actual minus predicted duration) of 0.25 minutes and a standard deviation residual of 6.1 minutes to retrospective treatment data. Waiting times are derived by summing the predicted durations. The main features that generated the best fit model (from most to least significant) are: Allocated appointment time, radiotherapy fraction number, median past duration of treatments, the number of treatment fields, and previous treatment duration.

DE Machine Learning; Text Mining; Machine Learning Techniques
AB The machine learning techniques are still extensively used for text mining. In this paper, there was a literature review of scientific journals published in the years 2010 and 2011, with the aim of identifying the main machine learning techniques utilized for text mining. It was possible to use descriptive and statistical techniques to organize, summarize and analyze the found data, and also, there is a shortened description of the main techniques found. Thirteen learning techniques applied to text mining appeared in the articles analyzed and 83% of the papers mentioned from 1 to 3 machine learning techniques. The main techniques used by the authors in the papers studied were support vector machine (SVM), k-means (K-M), k-nearest neighbors (K-NN), naive bayes (NB), self-organizing maps (SOM). Pairs of techniques that appear most frequently are SVM/NB, SVM/K-NN, SVM/Decision Tree and NB/K-NN.

AB An attribute assisted classification deriving estimates of interpretation confidence was performed. Instantaneous and coherency attributes were used in a supervised followed by an unsupervised classification resulting in an error envelope of the interpretation. In an initial approximation, confidence weights for a signal and background response are estimated using support vector machine learning. Subsequently, a weighted discrimination based on several coherency attributes using self-organizing maps is obtained. The resulting quantization is used as additional input and constraint in a final probability assessment of signal confidence using instantaneous attributes in support vector machine learning. The additional input in the form of quantization vectors and possible reduction in dimensionality of the input attribute vector space, allows to combine highly non-linear correlations in a multivariate discrimination. The trained classification is used to assign signal confidence probabilities to an interpreted seismic horizon. The proposed methodology is applied to an onshore data set from Wyoming, USA, revealing how single-and multi-trace attributes can be used to quantitatively assess the uncertainty of an interpretation often lost during project maturation.

DE Crowdsourcing; interactive machine learning
AB We present hybrid crowd-machine learning classifiers: classification models that start with a written description of a learning goal, use the crowd to suggest predictive features and label data, and then weigh these features using machine learning to produce models that are accurate and use human understandable features. These hybrid classifiers enable fast prototyping of machine learning models that can improve on both algorithm performance and human judgment, and accomplish tasks where automated feature extraction is not yet feasible. Flock, an interactive machine learning platform, instantiates this approach. To generate informative features, Flock asks the crowd to compare paired examples, an approach inspired by analogical encoding. The crowd's efforts can be focused on specific subsets of the input space where machine-extracted features are not predictive, or instead used to partition the input space and improve algorithm performance in subregions of the space. An evaluation on six prediction tasks, ranging from detecting deception to differentiating impressionist artists, demonstrated that aggregating crowd features improves upon both asking the crowd for a direct prediction and off-the-shelf machine learning features by over 10%. Further, hybrid systems that use both crowd-nominated and machine-extracted features can outperform those that use either in isolation.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB Machine learning has revolutionized a number of fields, but many micro-tomography users have never used it for their work. The micro-tomography beamline at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), in collaboration with the Center for Applied Mathematics for Energy Research Applications (CAMERA) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has now deployed a series of tools to automate data processing for ALS users using machine learning. This includes new reconstruction algorithms, feature extraction tools, and image classification and recommendation systems for scientific image. Some of these tools are either in automated pipelines that operate on data as it is collected or as stand-alone software. Others are deployed on computing resources at Berkeley Lab-from workstations to supercomputers-and made accessible to users through either scripting or easy-to-use graphical interfaces. This paper presents a progress report on this work.

AB Current machine learning (ML) algorithms identify statistical regularities in complex data sets and are regularly used across a range of application domains, but they lack the robustness and generalizability associated with human learning. If ML techniques could enable computers to learn from fewer examples, transfer knowledge between tasks, and adapt to changing contexts and environments, the results would have very broad scientific and societal impacts. Increased processing and memory resources have enabled larger, more capable learning models, but there is growing recognition that even greater computing resources would not be sufficient to yield algorithms capable of learning from a few examples and generalizing beyond initial training sets. This paper presents perspectives on feature selection, representation schemes and interpretability, transfer learning, continuous learning, and learning and adaptation in time-varying contexts and environments, five key areas that are essential for advancing ML capabilities. Appropriate learning tasks that require these capabilities can demonstrate the strengths of novel ML approaches that could address these challenges.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a popular machine learning method which can flexibly simulate the relationships of real-world classification applications. When facing problems (i.e., data sets) with a smaller number of samples (i.e., instances), ELM may often result in the overfitting trouble. In this paper, we propose a new Instance Cloned Extreme Learning Machine (IC-ELM for short) which can handle numerous different classification problems. IC-ELM uses an instance cloning method to balance the input data's distribution and extend the training data set, which alleviates the overfitting issue and enhances the testing classification accuracy. Experiments and comparisons on 20 UCI data sets, and validations on image and text classification applications, demonstrate that IC-ELM is able to achieve superior results compared to the original ELM algorithm and its variants, as well as several other classical machine learning algorithms.

AB Machine learning algorithms are widely used in cyber forensic biometric systems to analyze a subject's truthfulness in an interrogation. An analytical method (rather than experimental) to evaluate the security strength of these systems under potential cyber attacks is essential. In this paper, we formalize a theoretical method for analyzing the immunity of a machine learning based cyber forensic system against evidence tampering attack. We apply our theory on brain signal based forensic systems that use neural networks to classify responses from a subject. Attack simulation is run to validate our theoretical analysis results.

AB Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims to increase the time older people or disabled people can live in their home environment by assisting them in performing activities of daily living by the use of intelligent products. Localization and tracking of users in indoor environment are the main components of AAL. Wireless sensor networks is an effective technology to accomplish these services by using Received Signal Strength (RSS) information. This work seeks to investigate the effect of machine learning techniques on the accuracy of user movement prediction. Five base classifiers and two ensemble learning approaches are employed and the results are evaluated in terms of precision recall, and F-measure. A real-life benchmark dataset in the area of AAL is used for evaluation. The results show that J48 is the best performing model compared to the other base-level classifiers. It also shows that Bagged J48 achieves the best performance.

ID RECOGNITION; REGRESSION
AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) has been an important research topic over the last decade due to its high efficiency, easy-implementation, unification of classification and regression, and unification of binary and multi-class learning tasks. Though integrating these advantages. existing ELM algorithms pay little attention to optimizing the choice of kernels, which is indeed crucial to the performance of ELM in applications. More importantly, there is the lack of a general framework for ELM to integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources for classification. In this paper, we propose a general learning framework, termed multiple kernel extreme learning machines (MK-ELM), to address the above two issues. In the proposed MK-ELM, the optimal kernel combination weights and the structural parameters of ELM are jointly optimized. Following recent research on support vector machine (SVM) based MKL algorithms, we first design a sparse MK-ELM algorithm by imposing an l(1)-norm constraint on the kernel combination weights, and then extend it to a non-sparse scenario by substituting the l(1)-norm constraint with an l(p)-norm (p > 1) constraint. After that, a radius-incorporated MK-ELM algorithm which incorporates the radius of the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) is introduced. Three efficient optimization algorithms are proposed to solve the corresponding kernel learning problems. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on Protein, Oxford Flower17, Caltech101 and Alzheimer's disease data sets to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency. As the experimental results indicate, our proposed algorithms can achieve comparable or even better classification performance than state-of-the-art MKL algorithms, while incurring much less computational cost.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence has achieved great success in many important applications. Both novel machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep neural networks), and their distributed implementations play very critical roles in the success. In this tutorial, we will first review popular machine learning algorithms and the optimization techniques they use. Second, we will introduce widely used ways of parallelizing machine learning algorithms (including both data parallelism and model parallelism, both synchronous and asynchronous parallelization), and discuss their theoretical properties, strengths, and weakness. Third, we will present some recent works that try to improve standard parallelization mechanisms. Last, we will provide some practical examples of parallelizing given machine learning algorithms in online application (e.g. Recommendation and Ranking) by using popular distributed platforms, such as Spark MlLib, DMTK, and Tensorflow. By listening to this tutorial, the audience can form a clear knowledge framework about distributed machine learning, and gain some hands-on experiences on parallelizing a given machine learning algorithm using popular distributed systems.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB The 3-D integration helps improve performance and density of electronic systems. However, since electrical and thermal performance for 3-D integration is related to each other, their codesign is required. Machine learning, a promising approach in artificial intelligence, has recently shown promise for addressing engineering optimization problems. In this paper, we apply machine learning for the optimization of 3-D integrated systems where the electrical performance and thermal performance need to be analyzed together for maximizing performance. In such systems, modeling can be challenging due to the multiscale geometries involved, which increases computation time per iteration. In this paper, we show that machine learning can be applied to such systems where multiple parameters can be optimized to achieve the desired performance using the minimum number of iterations. These results have been compared with other promising optimization methods in this paper. The results show that on an average, 4.4%, 31.1%, and 6.9% improvement in temperature gradient, CPU time, and skew are possible using machine learning, as compared with other methods.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a promising model for training single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) and has been widely used for classification. However, ELM faces the challenge of arbitrarily selected parameters, e.g., the network weights and hidden biases. Therefore, many efforts have been made to enhance the performance of ELM, such as using evolutionary algorithms to explore promising areas of the solution space. Although evolutionary algorithms can explore promising areas of the solution space, they are not able to locate global optimum efficiently. In this paper, we present a new Memetic Algorithm (MA)-based Extreme Learning Machine (M-ELM for short). M-ELM embeds the local search strategy into the global optimization framework to obtain optimal network parameters. Experiments and comparisons on 46 UCI data sets validate the performance of M-ELM. The corresponding results demonstrate that M-ELM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ELM algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning has been utilized in various areas but it cannot be used at various mobile devices with heavy restriction on memory as it requires large memory and CPU power. This paper suggests machine learning algorithm, which can be used at mobile device with heavy restriction on memory. In this method, proximal SVM, which is judged to be effective by considering accuracy, computational complexity and memory usage, is used. Especially, the three most well-known algorithms are compared and analyzed to calculate inverse matrix. The algorithm, suggested by the experiment, shows the possibility of realtime learning at Arduino UNO with 2 KB SRAM.

DE Interactive machine learning; User interface; Interface metaphor
ID VISUALIZATION; FRAMEWORK
AB To promote more interactive and dynamic machine learning, we revisit the notion of user-interface metaphors. User-interface metaphors provide intuitive constructs for supporting user needs through interface design elements. A user-interface metaphor provides a visual or action pattern that leverages a user's knowledge of another domain. Metaphors suggest both the visual representations that should be used in a display as well as the interactions that should be afforded to the user. We argue that user-interface metaphors can also offer a method of extracting interaction-based user feedback for use in machine learning. Metaphors offer indirect, context-based information that can be used in addition to explicit user inputs, such as user-provided labels. Implicit information from user interactions with metaphors can augment explicit user input for active learning paradigms. Or it might be leveraged in systems where explicit user inputs are more challenging to obtain. Each interaction with the metaphor provides an opportunity to gather data and learn. We argue this approach is especially important in streaming applications, where we desire machine learning systems that can adapt to dynamic, changing data.

ID TIME PCR DATA
AB Introduction of fluorescence-based Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) is increasingly used to detect multiple pathogens simultaneously and rapidly by gene expression analysis of PCR amplification data. PCR data is analyzed often by setting an arbitrary threshold that intersect the signal curve in its exponential phase if it exists. The point at which the curve crosses the threshold is called Threshold Cycle (CT) for positive samples. On the other, when such cross of threshold does not occur, the sample is identified as negative. This simple and arbitrary however not an elegant definition of CT value sometimes leads to conclusions that are either false positive or negative. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present a stable and consistent alternative approach that is based on machine learning for the definition and determination of CT values.

DE randomized machine learning; entropy; optimimality
AB In this paper we propose a new machine learning concept called randomized machine learning, in which model parameters are assumed random and data are assumed to contain random errors. Distinction of this approach from "classical" machine learning is that optimal estimation deals with the probability density functions of random parameters and the "worst" probability density of random data errors. As the optimality criterion of estimation, randomized machine learning employs the generalized information entropy maximized on a set described by the system of empirical balances. We apply this approach to text classification and dynamic regression problems. The results illustrate capabilities of the approach.

ID ALGORITHM; NETWORK; ONLINE
AB This paper proposes a fast and effective sequential active learning method using meta-cognitive extreme learning machine (SEAL-ELM). The proposed algorithm consists of two components, namely the cognitive component and the meta-cognitive component. The cognitive component is an online sequential extreme learning machine while the meta-cognitive component controls the learning process of the cognitive component using a self-regulating mechanism to decide what to learn, when to learn and how to learn the arriving samples. Active learning is employed to select different strategies, namely sample deletion, sample reserve and sample learning strategy to determine whether the data will be deleted directly, reserved for later use or used immediately. This is the first time the similarity of meta-cognitive machine learning and active learning is exploited. The meta-cognition mechanism and active learning principle are utilized to reduce the labeling efforts and costs. The use of ELM greatly reduces the computation complexity of the learning process. The new algorithm is evaluated on a set of real-world benchmark classification problems. Simulation results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of sequential active learning and show that the SEAL-ELM can achieve similar or better learning accuracy with a much faster learning speed compared with the state-of-the-arts algorithms.

AB The preparation of labeled training data for supervised machine learning methods involves a lot of effort. Regarding surface inspection tasks, this endeavor is often not economically reasonable. In this paper, an artificial defect synthetization algorithm based on a multistep stochastic process is proposed. It adds defects to fault-free surface images, which can be used for supervised machine learning. By this means a deep convolutional neural network has been trained, achieving a detection rate of 94% of occurring real defects on the presented test surface.

AB In this paper, we present the current state-of-the-art of decision making (DM) and machine learning (ML) and bridge the two research domains to create an integrated approach of complex problem solving based on human and computational agents. We present a novel classification of ML, emphasizing the human-in-the-loop in interactive ML (iML) and more specific on collaborative interactive ML (ciML), which we understand as a deep integrated version of iML, where humans and algorithms work hand in hand to solve complex problems. Both humans and computers have specific strengths and weaknesses and integrating humans into machine learning processes might be a very efficient way for tackling problems. This approach bears immense research potential for various domains, e.g., in health informatics or in industrial applications. We outline open questions and name future challenges that have to be addressed by the research community to enable the use of collaborative interactive machine learning for problem solving in a large scale.

ID REGRESSION
AB With the development of technology and the widespread use of machine learning, more and more models need to be trained to mine useful knowledge from large scale data. It has become a challenging problem to train multiple models accurately and efficiently so as to make full use of limited computing resources. As one of ELM variants, online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) provides a method to learn from incremental data. MapReduce, which provides a simple, scalable and fault-tolerant framework, can be utilized for large scale learning. In this paper, we propose an efficient batch parallel online sequential extreme learning machine (BPOS-ELM) algorithm for the training of multiple models. BPOS-ELM estimates the Map execution time and Reduce execution time with historical statistics and generates execution plan. BPOS-ELM launches one MapReduce job to train multiple OS-ELM models according to the generated execution plan. BPOS-ELM is evaluated with real and synthetic data. The accuracy of BPOS-ELM is at the same level as those of OS-ELM and POS-ELM. The speedup of BPOS-ELM reaches 10 on a cluster with maximum 32 cores.

AB Confidence machine learning method is an important research content in machine learning area and of significant importance to high-risk machine learning application area. In confidence machine learning, design and calculation of confidence level is a difficulty; nevertheless, the algorithm in this paper enables confidence classification even when specific threshold setting is omitted and confidence level calculation for each example and unknown sample is neglected. Based on ensemble learning structure, this algorithm employs twice one-class classifier to classify binary problems, and with reject option being set, confidence learning of binary classification is performed by means of multi-layer ensemble learning. The algorithm has been validated on eight experimental datasets, such as heart disease and diabetes mellitus, and good results have been achieved. The learning method proposed in this paper can make the confidence machine learning easier and more efficient. In the era of big data, the research of pattern recognition algorithm based on small sample is still of great significance.

DE Declarative programming; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning
AB Declarative programming is a paradigm that allows programmers to specify what they want to compute, leaving how to compute it to a solver. Our declarative programming language, Dyna, is designed to compactly specify computations like those that are frequently encountered in machine learning. As a declarative language, Dyna's solver has a large space of (correct) strategies available to it. We describe a reinforcement learning framework for adaptively choosing among these strategies to maximize efficiency for a given workload. Adaptivity in execution is especially important for software that will run under a variety of workloads, where no fixed policy works well. We hope that reinforcement learning will identify good policies reasonably quickly-offloading the burden of writing efficient code from human programmers.

DE Extreme learning machine; Transfer learning (TL); Classification
ID FUNCTION APPROXIMATION; FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS
AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new method for using Single-hidden Layer Feed-forward Networks (SLFNs) with a much simpler training method. While conventional extreme learning machine are based on the training and test data which should be under the same distribution, in reality it is often desirable to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data. Transfer learning (TL) aims to solve related but different target domain problems by using plenty of labeled source domain data. When the task from one new domain comes, new domain samples are relabeled costly, and it would be a waste to discard all the old domain data. Therefore, an algorithm called TL-ELM based on the ELM algorithm is proposed, which uses a small amount of target domain tag data and a large number of source domain old data to build a high-quality classification model. The method inherits the advantages of ELM and makes up for the defects that traditional ELM cannot transfer knowledge. Experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed methods is superior to or at least comparable with existing benchmarking methods. In addition, a novel domain adaptation kernel extreme learning machine (TL-DAKELM) based on the kernel extreme learning machine was proposed with respect to the TL-ELM. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning approaches built to identify code clones fail to perform well due to insufficient training samples and have been restricted only up to Type-III clones. A majority of the publicly available code clone corpora are incomplete in nature and lack labeled samples for semantic or Type-IV clones. We present here two schemes for labeling all types of clones including Type-IV clones. We restrict our study to Java code only. First, we use an unsupervised approach to label Type-IV clones and validate them using expert Java programmers. Next, we present a supervised scheme for labeling (or classifying) unknown samples based on labeled samples derived from our first scheme. We evaluate the performance of our schemes using six well-known Java code clone corpora and report on the quality of produced clones in terms of kappa agreement, mean error and accuracy scores. Results show that both schemes produce high quality code clones facilitating future use of machine learning in detecting clones of Type-IV.

AB The impact-echo (IE) method is a popular non-destructive testing (NDT) technique widely used for measuring the thickness of plate-like structures and for detecting certain defects inside concrete elements or structures. However, the IE method is not effective for full condition assessment (i.e., defect detection, defect diagnosis, defect sizing and location), because the simple frequency spectrum analysis involved in the existing IE method is not sufficient to capture the IE signal patterns associated with different conditions. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the IE technique and enable it for full condition assessment of concrete elements by introducing advanced machine learning techniques for performing comprehensive analysis and pattern recognition of IE signals. Specifically, we use wavelet decomposition for extracting signatures or features out of the raw IE signals and apply extreme learning machine, one of the recently developed machine learning techniques, as classification models for full condition assessment. To validate the capabilities of the proposed method, we build a number of specimens with various types, sizes, and locations of defects and perform IE testing on these specimens in a lab environment. Based on analysis of the collected IE signals using the proposed machine learning based IE method, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in performing full condition assessment of concrete elements or structures.

AB We apply machine learning to data sets from shear laboratory experiments, with the goal of identifying hidden signals that precede earthquakes. Here we show that by listening to the acoustic signal emitted by a laboratory fault, machine learning can predict the time remaining before it fails with great accuracy. These predictions are based solely on the instantaneous physical characteristics of the acoustical signal and do not make use of its history. Surprisingly, machine learning identifies a signal emitted from the fault zone previously thought to be low-amplitude noise that enables failure forecasting throughout the laboratory quake cycle. We infer that this signal originates from continuous grain motions of the fault gouge as the fault blocks displace. We posit that applying this approach to continuous seismic data may lead to significant advances in identifying currently unknown signals, in providing new insights into fault physics, and in placing bounds on fault failure times.
   Plain Language Summary Predicting the timing and magnitude of an earthquake is a fundamental goal of geoscientists. In a laboratory setting, we show we can predict "labquakes" by applying new developments in machine learning (ML), which exploits computer programs that expand and revise themselves based on new data. We use ML to identify telltale sounds-much like a squeaky door-that predict when a quake will occur. The experiment closely mimics Earth faulting, so the same approach may work in predicting timing, but not size, of an earthquake. This approach could be applied to predict avalanches, landslides, failure of machine parts, and more.

AB Machine Learning (ML) studies algorithms which can learn from data to gain knowledge from experience and to make decisions and predictions. Health Informatics (HI) studies the effective use of probabilistic information for decision making. The combination of both has greatest potential to rise quality, efficacy and efficiency of treatment and care. Health systems worldwide are confronted with "big data" in high dimensions, where the inclusion of a human is impossible and automatic ML (aML) show impressive results. However, sometimes we are confronted with complex data, "little data", or rare events, where aML-approaches suffer of insufficient training samples. Here interactive ML (iML) may be of help, particularly with a doctor-in-the-loop, e.g. in subspace clustering, k-Anonymization, protein folding and protein design. However, successful application of ML for HI needs an integrated approach, fostering a concerted effort of four areas: (1) data science, (2) algorithms (with focus on networks and topology (structure), and entropy (time), (3) data visualization, and last but not least (4) privacy, data protection, safety & security.

   Machine; Extreme Learning Machine; Relevance Vector Machine
AB Classification of cancer determines appropriate treatment and helps determine the diagnosis. Cancer develops progressively from an alteration in a cell's genetic structure. This change results in cells with uncontrolled growth patterns. Cancer classification is made according to the site of origin of the malignant cells. This classification describes the type of tissue in which the cancer cells begin to develop. Here we used three common examples of site of origin classification: Lymphoma, Leukemia and SRBCT. The objective of this paper is to develop an effective machine learning approaches for cancer classification, which could provide reliable cancer classification with better accuracy. The work comprises of two steps. In the first step, using Analysis of VAriance (ANOVA) ranking scheme to choose the important genes. The second step involves the classification task using an efficient classifier. In this paper we use the three efficient machine learning classifiers such as Fast Support Vector Machine Learning (FSVML), Fast Extreme Learning Machine Learning (FELML) and Relevance Vector Machine Learning (RVMMLML). The investigational values are computed using three site of origin classification namely Lymphoma, Leukemia and SRBCT. The results are interpreted in terms of Testing Accuracy and Training Time. From the investigational results, it is concluded that the proposed RVMMLML machine learning approach gives better testing accuracy results for all the datasets considered.

AB Regression testing is the common task of retesting software that has been changed or extended (e.g., by new features) during software evolution. As retesting the whole program is not feasible with reasonable time and cost, usually only a subset of all test cases is executed for regression testing, e.g., by executing test cases according to test case prioritization. Although a vast amount of methods for test case prioritization exist, they mostly require access to source code (i.e., white-box). However, in industrial practice, system-level testing is an important task that usually grants no access to source code (i.e., black-box). Hence, for an effective regression testing process, other information has to be employed. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for test case prioritization for manual system-level regression testing based on supervised machine learning. Our approach considers black-box meta-data, such as test case history, as well as natural language test case descriptions for prioritization. We use the machine learning algorithm SVM Rank to evaluate our approach by means of two subject systems and measure the prioritization quality. Our results imply that our technique improves the failure detection rate significantly compared to a random order. In addition, we are able to outperform a test case order given by a test expert. Moreover, using natural language descriptions improves the failure finding rate.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model which learn very faster than other neural networks model but the solution was not suitable as expected since the randomness of the input weights and biases may cause to the nonfulfillment of solution. Flower Pollination Extreme Learning Machine (FP-ELM) model that it was merged by ELM and Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) to adjust the input weight and biases for improve performance of output weight when the input weight and biases were calculated. Nonetheless, FP-ELM may cause overfitting and more number of hidden nodes were used. In this paper, Meta Learning of Flower Pollination Extreme Learning Machine (Meta-FPELM) was proposed that compart the input weight, calculate to hidden nodes as FP-ELM and combine to the last output weight. In addition, the result of real word regression problems experiment of MetaFPELM compared with state-of-the-art show that Meta-FPELM can overcome five-eighth in testing phase for all datasets.

AB Graph-based and deep learning-based semi supervised learning algorithms have been successfully used for semantic extraction from large unstructured data, alongside alternative methods like dimensionality reduction and embedding. Semantic information in the form of edges linking similar instances can be utilized to learn from unlabeled data and low-dimensional embeddings can be used to visualize and classify them. In this paper, we solve the problem of extending nonlinear embedding algorithms to Multi-Layered Extreme Learning Machines by plugging the network to auxiliary layers to improve the sem-isupervised learning performance by further building on the structure assumption of data. Our model is significantly different from the previous models in two ways.
   1) It relies on the structural property of the data and the similarity of instances belonging to the same class.
   2) Our model relies on manifold regularisation and embedding technique to classify from hidden representation.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) works for generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), and its essence is that the hidden layer of SLFNs need not be tuned. But ELM only utilizes labeled data to carry out the supervised learning task. In order to exploit unlabeled data in the ELM model, we first extend the manifold regularization (MR) framework and then demonstrate the relation between the extended MR framework and ELM. Finally, a manifold regularized extreme learning machine is derived from the proposed framework, which maintains the properties of ELM and can be applicable to large-scale learning problems. Experimental results show that the proposed semi-supervised extreme learning machine is the most cost-efficient method. It tends to have better scalability and achieve satisfactory generalization performance at a relatively faster learning speed than traditional semi-supervised learning algorithms.

AB This research analyzes the affinities between two well-known learning schemes that apply randomization in the training process, namely, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and the learning framework using similarity functions. These paradigms share a common approach to inductive learning, which combines an explicit data remapping with a linear separator; however, they seem to exploit different strategies in the design of the mapping layer. This paper shows that the theory of learning with similarity functions can stimulate a novel reinterpretation of ELM, thus leading to a common framework. This in turn allows one to improve the strategy applied by ELM for the setup of the neurons' parameters. Experimental results confirm that the new approach may improve over the standard strategy in terms of the trade-off between classification accuracy and dimensionality of the remapped space.

The resulted high-level understanding the content of images received from certain visual sensing system and belonged to an appearance space can be only a key first step in solving various specific tasks such as mobile robot navigation in uncertain environments, road detection in autonomous driving systems, etc. Appearance-based learning has become very popular in the field of machine vision. In general, the appearance of a scene is a function of the scene content, the lighting conditions, and the camera position. Mobile robots localization problem in machine learning framework via appearance space analysis is considered. This problem is reduced to certain regression on an appearance manifold problem, and newly regression on manifolds methods are used for its solution.

AB The ECG uses some methods to diagnose these cardiac arrhythmias and tries to correct the diagnosis. ECG signals are characterized by a collection of waves such as P, Q, R, S, T. These five waves are preformed, wave transformed, and classified. In the current literature, the P, Q, R, S, T waves in ECG signals are classified using some machine learning techniques. In the work to be done, MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification techniques which are not compared with each other using these signals will be compared. Is study, BP (Back Propagation) algorithm with MLP classifier and KA (Kernel-Adatron) algorithm with SVM classifier were used. In addition, the use of these methods is new in the field of ECG classification. It will try to find a more effective method with new uses in the study and the literature will contribute to this area. In addition, wave transformation techniques such as DWT, DCT, and CWT will be used to increase the success of the classification used in the study. This will lead to the most effective classification method in the existing data set. In the work to be done, it is aimed to bring improvements to the classification methods used in existing studies. It is aimed to develop a method to improve the calculation time and standard classification performance of MLP and SVM, and it is aimed to contribute to the informed consciousness of this work.

AB Feature extraction and Machine Learning (ML) techniques are required to reduce high variability of biometric data in Biometric Authentication Systems (BAS) toward improving system utilization (acceptance of legitimate subjects). However, reduction in data variability, also decreases the adversary's effort in manufacturing legitimate biometric data to break the system (security strength). Typically for BAS design, security strength is evaluated through variability analysis on data, regardless of feature extraction and ML, which are essential for accurate evaluation. In this research, we provide a geometrical method to measure the security strength in HAS, which analyzes the effects of feature extraction and ML on the biometric data. Using the proposed method, we evaluate the security strength of five state-of-the-art electroencephalogram based authentication systems, on data from 106 subjects, and the maximum achievable security strength is 83 bits.

AB There has been intensive research from academics and practitioners regarding models for predicting bankruptcy and default events, for credit risk management. Seminal academic research has evaluated bankruptcy using traditional statistics techniques (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and early artificial intelligence models (e.g. artificial neural networks). In this study, we test machine learning models (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random forest) to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event, and compare their performance with results from discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks. We use data from 1985 to 2013 on North American firms, integrating information from the Salomon Center database and Compustat, analysing more than 10,000 firm-year observations. The key insight of the study is a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy using machine learning techniques especially when, in addition to the original Altman's Z-score variables, we include six complementary financial indicators. Based on Carton and Hofer (2006), we use new variables, such as the operating margin, change in return-on-equity, change in price-to-book, and growth measures related to assets, sales, and number of employees, as predictive variables. Machine learning models show, on average, approximately 10% more accuracy in relation to traditional models. Comparing the best models, with all predictive variables, the machine learning technique related to random forest led to 87% accuracy, whereas logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis led to 69% and 50% accuracy, respectively, in the testing sample. We find that bagging, boosting, and random forest models outperform the others techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in the testing sample improves when the additional variables are included. Our research adds to the discussion of the continuing debate about superiority of computational methods over statistical techniques such as in Tsai, Hsu, and Yen (2014) and Yeh, Chi, and Lin (2014). In particular, for machine learning mechanisms, we do not find SVM to lead to higher accuracy rates than other models. This result contradicts outcomes from Danenas and Garsva (2015) and Cleofas-Sanchez, Garcia, Marques, and Senchez (2016), but corroborates, for instance, Wang, Ma, and Yang (2014), Liang, Lu, Tsai, and Shih (2016), and Cano et al. (2017). Our study supports the applicability of the expert systems by practitioners as in Heo and Yang (2014), Kim, Kang, and Kim (2015) and Xiao, Xiao, and Wang (2016). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB During the last decades, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been taking place in several technical and scientific areas. Despite its success, AI applications to solve real-life problems in pavement engineering are far from reaching its potential. In this paper, a Python machine learning library, scikit-learn, is used to predict asphalt pavement friction. Using data from the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database, 113 different sections of asphalt concrete pavement, spread all over the United States, were selected. Two machine learning models were built from these data to predict friction, one based on linear regression and the other on regularized regression with lasso. Both models showed to be feasible and perform similarly. According to the results, initial friction plays an essential role in the way friction evolves over time. The results of this study also showed that scikit-learn can be a versatile tool to solve pavement engineering problems. By applying machine learning methods to predict asphalt pavements friction, this paper emphasizes how theory and practice can be effectively coupled to solve real-life problems in contemporary transportation.

AB In recent years, air quality has become a severe environmental problem in China. Since bad air quality brought significant influences on traffic and people's daily life, how to predict the future air quality precisely and subtly, has been an urgent and important problem. In this paper, a Spatio-Temporal Extreme Learning Machine (STELM) method is proposed for air quality prediction. STELM considers temporal and spatial characteristics of air quality data and related meteorological data, constructs a prediction model based on ELM, and realizes air quality prediction with more than 80% precision. A prototype system is implemented and the experiments on practical air quality data in Beijing validate the effectiveness of our method and system.

AB In the current era of big data, high volumes of a wide variety of data of different veracity can be easily collected or generated at a high velocity. Embedded in these big data is valuable information or knowledge. This calls for machine learning techniques for supporting advanced knowledge discovery from these big heterogeneous data. A rich source of big data is game data, which include data collected from sports games, card games, online video games, and board games like chess games. The deep interaction and simplicity of representation afforded by the game of chess have worked together to produce one of the most studied games in the world. It is a great intellectual challenge, and not only for humans. While chess engines can sometimes play chess better than grandmasters and can be used to assist the study of games or individual positions, the engines may not help a chess student choose which games to study. In this paper, we present a machine learning system with unsupervised learning and supervised learning components to analyze big chess data. Evaluation results show that not only can machine learning help find interesting games, but also that chess can be a great testing ground for machine learning and data mining techniques for big data analytics.

We approach the standard Extreme Learning Machine algorithm from a probabilistic point of view, Subsequently and we devise a method for the calculation of the network target vectors for Extreme Learning Machine based neural network training that is based on a Bayesian model exploiting both the labeling information available for the training data and geometric class information in the feature space determined by the network's hidden layer outputs. We combine the derived subspace learning method with Nearest Neighbor-based classification and compare its performance with that of the standard ELM approach and other standard methods.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed for solving a single-layer feed-forward network (SLFN) with fast learning speed and has been confirmed to be effective and efficient for pattern classification and regression in different fields. ELM originally focuses on the supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning problems, but just in the single domain. To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability in subspace learning has not been exploited very well. Inspired by a cognitive-based extreme learning machine technique (Cognit Comput. 6:376-390, 1; Cognit Comput. 7:263-278, 2.), this paper proposes a unified subspace transfer framework called cross-domain extreme learning machine (CdELM), which aims at learning a common (shared) subspace across domains. Three merits of the proposed CdELM are included: (1) A cross-domain subspace shared by source and target domains is achieved based on domain adaptation; (2) ELM is well exploited in the cross-domain shared subspace learning framework, and a new perspective is brought for ELM theory in heterogeneous data analysis; (3) the proposed method is a subspace learning framework and can be combined with different classifiers in recognition phase, such as ELM, SVM, nearest neighbor, etc. Experiments on our electronic nose olfaction datasets demonstrate that the proposed CdELM method significantly outperforms other compared methods.

AB In this paper, we present an Online Sequential Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (OS-RKELM). In OS-RKELM, only a small part of the instances in the original training samples is employed for training the kernel neurons, while the output weights are attained analytically. Similar to the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM), OS-RKELM learns data samples in a chunk-by-chunk or one-by-one mode and does not require an archival of the data sample once it has been learned. OS-RKELM also contains few control parameters, thus avoiding the need for cumbersome fine-tuning of the algorithm. OS-RKELM supports a widespread types of kernels as hidden neurons and is capable of addressing the singular problem that arises when the initial training samples are smaller than the neuron size. A comprehensive performance evaluation of the OS-RKELM against other state-of-the-art sequential learning algorithms, including OS-ELM, Large-scale Active Support Vector Machine (LASVM) and Budgeted Stochastic Gradient Descent Support Vector Machine (BSGD) using popular time series, regression and classification benchmarks have been conducted. Experimental results obtained indicate that the proposed OS-RKELM showcases improved prediction accuracy and efficiency over the OS-ELM, LASVM and BSGD in many cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) was known for its extremely fast learning speed while maintaining acceptable generalization. Unfortunately, the failure of ELM on big data occurs frequently. The course is, the main computation of ELM focus on the calculation of generalized inverse of hidden layer output matrix, which depends on singular value decomposition (SVD) and has very low efficiency especially on high order matrix. In view of this high calculation complexity directly courses the failure of ELM on big data, normal equation extreme learning machine is proposed, which use the normal equation to reduce the size of the matrix equation and overcome the failure. The experiments on benchmarks show that the new proposed model has better performance than the ELM, so as to have more potential for large scale data learning.

AB OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this article are to describe concepts that radiologists should understand to evaluate machine learning projects, including common algorithms, supervised as opposed to unsupervised techniques, statistical pitfalls, and data considerations for training and evaluation, and to briefly describe ethical dilemmas and legal risk.
   CONCLUSION. Machine learning includes a broad class of computer programs that improve with experience. The complexity of creating, training, and monitoring machine learning indicates that the success of the algorithms will require radiologist involvement for years to come, leading to engagement rather than replacement.

ID VISUALIZATION
AB Semi-supervised learning with a growing self-organizing map (GSOM) is commonly used to cope with the machine learning problems. The performance of semi-supervised GSOM is associated with the structure of clustering layer, the activation level, and the weights of a classifier. Current methods have been advocated to calibrate the GSOM parameters based on local point approach. The local point approach is associated with structure of dataset. On the other hand, the semi-supervised GSOM output is so closely intertwined with problem inputs. This paper present an analytical semi-supervised learning method based on GSOM and extreme learning machine. Extreme learning machine was used to exploit the substantial classification response. However, the learning of GSOMparameters was eliminated with use of the extreme learning machine. Furthermore, the sequential extreme learning machine was implemented to achieve an online semi-supervised GSOM for streaming dataset. This study showed the proposed method converges to optimum response regardless to structure of dataset. The proposed method was applied on the online and partially labeled dataset. Online semi-supervised GSOM integrated with extreme learning machine achievement implies that the F-measure of proposed method is more precise than the conventional semi-supervised GSOM.

AB Learning ability in Robotics is acknowledged as one of the major challenges facing artificial intelligence. Although in the numerous areas within Robotics machine learning (ML) has long identified as a core technology, recently Robot learning, in particular, has been witnessing major challenges due to the theoretical advancement at the boundary between optimization and ML. In fact the integration of ML and optimization reported to be able to dramatically increase the decision-making quality and learning ability in decision systems. Here the novel integration of ML and optimization which can be applied to the complex and dynamic contexts of Robot learning is described. Furthermore with the aid of an educational Robotics kit the proposed methodology is evaluated.

AB This paper focuses on machine learning techniques for real-time detection. Although many supervised learning techniques have been described in the literature, no technique always performs best. Several comparative studies are available, but have not always been performed carefully, leading to invalid conclusions. Since benchmarking all techniques is a tremendous task, literature has been used to limit the available options, selecting the two most promising techniques (AdaBoost and SVM), out of 11 different Machine Learning techniques. Based on a thorough comparison using 2 datasets and simulating noise in the feature set as well as in the labeling, AdaBoost is concluded to be the best machine learning technique for real-time target detection as its performance is comparable to SVM, its detection time is one or multiple orders of magnitude faster, its inherent feature selection eliminates this as a separate task, while it is more straightforward to use (only three coupled parameters to tune) and has a lower training time.

AB Support vector machine (SVM) based intrusion detection system (IDS) presently working as the machine learning approach for classification. It helps to detect new attacks from the datasets which are used in the machine learning. At IDS, the task of the machine learning method is to construct a projectile model which can be distinguished between normal and illegitimate activity. Any IDS can be developed to get high accuracy, high detection rate and low false positive rate, which show the efficiency of that intrusion detection system. In this paper, we use a direct kernel method with SVM classifier to get the high accuracy and detection rate, also low false positive rate. For the performance evaluation of the projected system we use KDDCup99 dataset, NSL-KDD dataset and Kyoto 2006+ datasets.

AB Extreme learning Machine (ELM) has emerged as an efficient and effective learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. Most of the existing research on the ELMS mainly focus on supervised learning. Recently, researchers have extended ELMs for semi-supervised learning, in which they exploit both the labeled and unlabeled data in order to enhance the learning performances. They have incorporated Laplacian regularization to determine the geometry of the underlying manifold. However, Laplacian regularization lacks extrapolating power and biases the solution towards a constant function. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm called Hessian semi-supervised ELM (HSS-ELM) to enhance the semi-supervised learning of ELM. Unlike the Laplacian regularization, the Hessian regularization that favors functions whose values vary linearly along the geodesic distance and preserves the local manifold structure well. This leads to good extrapolating power. Furthermore, HSS-ELM maintains almost all the advantages of the traditional ELM such as the significant training efficiency and straight forward implementation for multiclass classification problems. The proposed algorithm is tested on publicly available data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is competitive with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning algorithms in term of accuracy. Additionally, HSS-ELM requires remarkably less training time compared to semi-supervised SVMs/regularized least-squares methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) as an emerging technology has achieved exceptional performance in large-scale settings, and is well suited to binary and multi-class classification, as well as regression tasks. However, existing ELM and its variants predominantly employ single hidden layer feedforward networks, leaving the popular and potentially powerful stacked generalization principle unexploited for seeking predictive deep representations of input data. Deep architectures can find higher-level representations, thus can potentially capture relevant higher-level abstractions. But most of current deep learning methods require solving a difficult and non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a stacked model, DrELM, to learn deep representations via extreme learning machine according to stacked generalization philosophy. The proposed model utilizes ELM as a base building block and incorporates random shift and kernelization as stacking elements. Specifically, in each layer. DrELM integrates a random projection of the predictions obtained by ELM into the original feature, and then applies kernel functions to generate the resultant feature. To verify the classification and regression performance of DrELM, we conduct the experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. The experimental results show that DrELM outperforms ELM and kernel ELMs, which appear to demonstrate that DrELM could yield predictive features that are suitable for prediction tasks. The performances of the deep models (i.e. Stacked Auto-encoder) are comparable. However, due to the utilization of ELM, DrELM is easier to learn and faster in testing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Autistic children often develop abnormal habits and in some cases they could be unsafe or even dangerous to themselves and their family members. Because of their limited speech ability, their inexperienced parents may underestimate their physical abilities compared to their intellectual level and may not realize that they could easily hurt themselves. Therefore, the need for an automatic alert system for autistic child parent assistance is great, and it will enhance the life experience for both the autistic child and the family.
   In this paper, we present a machine learning based electronic system for autism activity recognition using wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The system accurately detects autistic child gesture and motion. The system is named Autistic child Sensor and Assistant System (ACSA), and is comprised of three main components: the ACSA Wearable sensor device, the companion ACSA Parent Application and the machine learning algorithms developed for autistic movement event detection and processing. The paper describes the system concepts, its components and details of its architecture and operation.
   Individuals and families with Autism Spectrum Disorder children can utilize this system as alarming devices that assist them to protect their autistic child regardless of the environment. The proposed system is expected to enhance the life experience for all aides, the autistic child, the parents, and the autistic child whole family.

AB Nonlinear photonic delay systems present interesting implementation platforms for machine learning models. They can be extremely fast, offer great degrees of parallelism and potentially consume far less power than digital processors. So far they have been successfully employed for signal processing using the Reservoir Computing paradigm. In this paper we show that their range of applicability can be greatly extended if we use gradient descent with backpropagation through time on a model of the system to optimize the input encoding of such systems. We perform physical experiments that demonstrate that the obtained input encodings work well in reality, and we show that optimized systems perform significantly better than the common Reservoir Computing approach. The results presented here demonstrate that common gradient descent techniques from machine learning may well be applicable on physical neuro-inspired analog computers.

   one-class classification
AB Gas turbine combustor anomaly detection plays a critical role in reducing operation and maintenance costs in power plant operations. One-class classification, to learn a model that properly describes the normal samples, is one of many anomaly detection approaches that have shown promising performance in real-world applications. Extreme learning machines (ELMs), a recent developed machine learning technique, have outperformed SVMs and other machine learning methods for many machine learning problems. ELMs have been originally used for binary or multiclass classification and regression as well. Using ELM for one-class classification has emerged very recently, but has not been widely explored for real world applications. In this paper, we adopt ELMs to a new application domain - industrial machine condition monitoring. More specifically, we apply one-class ELMs for more accurate anomaly detection of gas turbine combustors. We evaluate different one-class ELMs and compare them against other one-class classifiers. Using a real-world gas turbine combustor anomaly detection as the case study, we demonstrate that one-class ELMs can be more effective than other one-class classification algorithms in early detecting gas turbine combustor anomalies.

DE Scalable Machine Learning; Big Data; Distributed Systems
AB Many systems have been developed for machine learning at scale. Performance has steadily improved, but there has been relatively little work on explicitly defining or approaching the limits of performance. In this paper we describe the application of roofline design, an approach borrowed from computer architecture, to large-scale machine learning. In roofline design, one exposes ALU, memory, and network limits, and the constraints they imply for algorithms. Using roofline design, we have developed a system called BIDMach which has demonstrated the highest performance to date for many ML problems. On one GPU-accelerated node, it generally outperforms other single-machine toolkits and cluster toolkits running on 100s of nodes. This performance level is enabled by a relatively small number of rooflined matrix primitives. Such performance implies a dramatic reduction in the energy used to perform these calculations. Beyond matrix kernels, roofline design can be applied to the end-to-end design of machine learning algorithms which minimize memory usage to optimize speed. This approach offers a further 2x to 3x gain in performance.
   Roofline design can also be applied to network primitives. We describe recent work on a sparse allreduce primitive called Kylix. We have shown that Kylix approaches the practical network throughput limit for allreduce, a basic primitive for distributed machine learning. Using Kylix, we describe an efficient transformation from model-parallel to data-parallel calculations. This transformation uses a secondary storage roofline, with similar parameters to the network. Finally, we describe several deployments of these techniques on real-world problems in two large internet companies. Once again, single node rooflined design demonstrated substantial gains over alternatives on either single nodes or clusters.

AB Machine learning is a subdivision of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is concerned with the design and development of intelligent algorithms that enables machines to learn from data without being programmed. Machine learning mainly focus on how to automatically recognize complex patterns among data and make intelligent decisions. In this paper, intelligent machine learning algorithms are used to classify the type of an eye disease based on ophthalmology data collected from patients of Mecca hospital in Sudan. Three machine-learning techniques are used to predict the severity of the eye that occurred during the investigation, which are Naive Bayesian, SVM, and J48 decision tree. The obtained result showed that J48 classifier outperforms both Naive Bayesian as well as SVM.

AB In human learning process, teachers play an important role of transferring knowledge and providing some additional information for better understanding. In machine learning, the role of the teacher has been mostly ignored. Introduction of a new learning paradigm named Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) includes the elements of human teaching in machine learning. This paper proposes a learning method using privileged information based on a Sparse Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Our method aims to improve the classification performance by reducing the testing error. Experimental results show improvements in training accuracy and testing error reduction over the classical methods in classification.

AB Machine learning (ML) is an increasingly popular statistical tool for analyzing either measured or calculated data sets. Here, we explore its application to a well-defined physics problem, investigating issues of how the underlying physics is handled by ML, and how self-consistent solutions can be found by limiting the domain in which ML is applied. The particular problem is how to find accurate approximate density functionals for the kinetic energy (KE) of noninteracting electrons. Kernel ridge regression is used to approximate the KE of non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional box as a functional of their density. The properties of different kernels and methods of cross-validation are explored, reproducing the physics faithfully in some cases, but not others. We also address how self-consistency can be achieved with information on only a limited electronic density domain. Accurate constrained optimal densities are found via a modified Euler-Lagrange constrained minimization of the machine-learned total energy, despite the poor quality of its functional derivative. A projected gradient descent algorithm is derived using local principal component analysis. Additionally, a sparse grid representation of the density can be used without degrading the performance of the methods. The implications for machine-learned density functional approximations are discussed. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Artificial intelligence, and particularly machine learning, has been used in many ways by the research community to turn a variety of diverse and even heterogeneous data sources into high quality facts and knowledge, providing premier capabilities to accurate pattern discovery. However, applying machine learning strategies on big and complex datasets is computationally expensive, and it consumes a very large amount of logical and physical resources, such as data file space, CPU, and memory. A sophisticated platform for efficient big data analytics is becoming more important these days as the data amount generated in a daily basis exceeds over quintillion bytes. Apache Spark MLlib is one of the most prominent platforms for big data analysis which offers a set of excellent functionalities for different machine learning tasks ranging from regression, classification, and dimension reduction to clustering and rule extraction. In this contribution, we explore, from the computational perspective, the expanding body of the Apache Spark MLlib 2.0 as an open-source, distributed, scalable, and platform independent machine learning library. Specifically, we perform several real world machine learning experiments to examine the qualitative and quantitative attributes of the platform. Furthermore, we highlight current trends in big data machine learning research and provide insights for future work.

AB Malware detection is a vital think about the protection of the Personal computer systems. However, presently using signature-based strategies cannot offer correct detection of zero-day attacks and polymorphic viruses. That's why the requirement for machine learning-based detection arises.
   The purpose of this work was to work out the most effective feature extraction, feature illustration, and classification ways that end in the most effective accuracy. This work presents suggested ways for machine learning based malware classification and detection, also as the tips for its implementation. Moreover, the study performed is often helpful as a base for any analysis within the field of malware analysis with machine learning strategies

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) has demonstrated great potential in machine learning and data mining. Smoothing strategy is an important technology for continuous optimizations. In this work, we apply a smoothing technique to replace the hinge loss function by an accurate smooth approximation. This will allow us to solve ELM as an unconstrained minimization problem directly. We term this reformulated problem as smooth ELM (SELM). A Newton-Armijo algorithm is used to solve the proposed SELM, and the resulting algorithm converges globally and quadratically. The proposed SELM with fast running speed has less decision variables and can better deal with nonlinear problems than the existing smooth support vector machine. Numerical experiments on various types of datasets including two-class datasets and multi-class datasets demonstrate that the speed of SELM is much faster than that of the existing ELM models. And compared with other popular algorithms of support vector machine and ELM, the proposed SELM achieves better or similar generalization. These demonstrate the effectiveness and fast speed of the algorithm.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently attracted many researchers' interest due to its very fast learning speed, good generalization ability, and ease of implementation. It provides a unified solution that can be used directly to solve regression, binary, and multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a stacked ELMs (S-ELMs) that is specially designed for solving large and complex data problems. The S-ELMs divides a single large ELM network into multiple stacked small ELMs which are serially connected. The S-ELMs can approximate a very large ELM network with small memory requirement. To further improve the testing accuracy on big data problems, the ELM autoencoder can be implemented during each iteration of the S-ELMs algorithm. The simulation results show that the S-ELMs even with random hidden nodes can achieve similar testing accuracy to support vector machine (SVM) while having low memory requirements. With the help of ELM autoencoder, the S-ELMs can achieve much better testing accuracy than SVM and slightly better accuracy than deep belief network (DBN) with much faster training speed.

AB With the advent of 21st Century, we stepped into the fourth industrial revolution of cyber physical systems. There is the need of secured network systems and intrusion detection systems in order to detect network attacks. Use of machine learning for anomaly detection in industrial networks faces challenges which restricts its large-scale commercial deployment. ADIN Suite proposes a roadmap to overcome these challenges with multi-module solution. It solves the need for real world network traffic, an adaptive hybrid analysis to reduce error rates in diverse network traffic and alarm correlation for semantic description of detection results to the network operator.

AB As demonstrated earlier, the learning accuracy of the single-layer-feedforward-network (SLFN) is generally far lower than expected, which has been a major bottleneck for many applications. In fact, for some large real problems, it is accepted that after tremendous learning time (within finite epochs), the network output error of SLFN will stop or reduce increasingly slowly. This report offers an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based learning method, referred to as the parent-offspring progressive learning method. The proposed method works by separating the data points into various parts, and then multiple ELMs learn and identify the clustered parts separately. The key advantages of the proposed algorithms as compared to the traditional supervised methods are twofold. First, it extends the ELM learning method from a single neural network to a multi-network learning system, as the proposed multiELM method can approximate any target continuous function and classify disjointed regions. Second, the proposed method tends to deliver a similar or much better generalization performance than other learning methods. All the methods proposed in this paper are tested on both artificial and real datasets.

AB Microscopically small solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, known as particulate matter (PM), may significantly affect not only human health but also urban, natural and agricultural systems. Therefore, it is imperative to keep the concentration levels of these pollutants below harmful thresholds. Forecasting tools based on machine learning have been used to estimate the concentration of PM and other pollutants in the atmosphere. However, PM data are uninterruptedly collected over time, thus producing a stream of data whose distribution may evolve over time. As traditional machine learning techniques do not have mechanisms to handle changes on data distribution at running time, they usually present limited prediction accuracy when facing such scenario. The overall goal of this work is to evaluate whether online sequential learning can improve the estimation accuracy of PM forecasting. To do so, online and offline algorithms based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) were compared, in order to evaluate their performance when applied to forecast hourly concentrations of PM. The experiments were performed using real-world data streams of PM concentration from different cities of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The obtained results show not only that online sequential learning approaches lead to smaller mean squared errors but also that the stability of the results is enhanced when such approaches are combined in ensembles.

ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; HYBRID
AB BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers with a high mortality rate among women. With the early diagnosis of breast cancer survival will increase from 56% to more than 86%. Therefore, an accurate and reliable system is necessary for the early diagnosis of this cancer. The proposed model is the combination of rules and different machine learning techniques. Machine learning models can help physicians to reduce the number of false decisions. They try to exploit patterns and relationships among a large number of cases and predict the outcome of a disease using historical cases stored in datasets.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to propose a rule-based classification method with machine learning techniques for the prediction of different types of Breast cancer survival.
   METHODS: We use a dataset with eight attributes that include the records of 900 patients in which 876 patients (97.3%) and 24 (2.7%) patients were females and males respectively. Naive Bayes (NB), Trees Random Forest (TRF), 1-Nearest Neighbor (1NN), AdaBoost (AD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), RBF Network (RBFN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning techniques with 10-cross fold technique were used with the proposed model for the prediction of breast cancer survival. The performance of machine learning techniques were evaluated with accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under ROC curve.
   RESULTS: Out of 900 patients, 803 patients and 97 patients were alive and dead, respectively. In this study, Trees Random Forest (TRF) technique showed better results in comparison to other techniques (NB, 1NN, AD, SVM and RBFN, MLP). The accuracy, sensitivity and the area under ROC curve of TRF are 96%, 96%, 93%, respectively. However, 1NN machine learning technique provided poor performance (accuracy 91%, sensitivity 91% and area under ROC curve 78%).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Trees Random Forest model (TRF) which is a rule-based classification model was the best model with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, this model is recommended as a useful tool for breast cancer survival prediction as well as medical decision making.

AB Most of semi-supervised learning algorithms based on manifold regularization framework are surface learning algorithms, such as semi-supervised ELM (SS-ELM) and Laplacian smooth twin support vector machine (Lap-STSVM). Multi-layer extreme learning machine (ML-ELM) stacks extreme learning machine based auto encoder (ELM-AE) to create a multi-layer neural network. ML-ELM not only approximates the complicated function but also achieves fast training time. The outputs of ELM-AE are the same as inputs, which cannot guarantee the effectiveness of the learning feature representations. We put forward extreme learning machine based denoising auto encoder (ELM-DAE) which introduces local denoising criterion into ELM-AE and is used as the basic component for Denoising ML-ELM. Resembling ML-ELM, Denoising ML-ELM stacks ELM-DAE to create a deep network. And then we introduce manifold regularization into the model of Denoising ML-ELM and propose denoising Laplacian ML-ELM (Denoising Lap-ML-ELM). Denoising Lap-ML-ELM is more efficient than SS-ELM in classification and does not need to spend too much time. Experimental results show that Denoising ML-ELM and Denoising Lap-ML-ELM are effective learning algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and objective: Smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and diseases in the developed world, and advances in modern electronics and machine learning can help us deliver real-time intervention to smokers in novel ways. In this paper, we examine different machine learning approaches to use situational features associated with having or not having urges to smoke during a quit attempt in order to accurately classify high-urge states.
   Methods: To test our machine learning approaches, specifically, Bayes, discriminant analysis and decision tree learning methods, we used a dataset collected from over 300 participants who had initiated a quit attempt. The three classification approaches are evaluated observing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision.
   Results: The outcome of the analysis showed that algorithms based on feature selection make it possible to obtain high classification rates with only a few features selected from the entire dataset. The classification tree method outperformed the naive Bayes and discriminant analysis methods, with an accuracy of the classifications up to 86%. These numbers suggest that machine learning may be a suitable approach to deal with smoking cessation matters, and to predict smoking urges, outlining a potential use for mobile health applications.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, machine learning classifiers can help identify smoking situations, and the search for the best features and classifier parameters significantly improves the algorithms' performance. In addition, this study also supports the usefulness of new technologies in improving the effect of smoking cessation interventions, the management of time and patients by therapists, and thus the optimization of available health care resources. Future studies should focus on providing more adaptive and personalized support to people who really need it, in a minimum amount of time by developing novel expert systems capable of delivering real-time interventions.

AB Nowadays, time series prediction is a hot issue in machine learning, however, how to predict time series fast and accurately remains extremely challengeable. In this paper, we proposed an Improved Error Minimized Extreme Learning Machine (IEM-ELM) algorithm which has better accuracy and prediction on change in direction (POCID) compared with Error Minimized Extreme Learning Machine (EM-ELM) for stock price prediction, meanwhile we implement the Online Sequential algorithm based on IEM-ELM (OSIEM-ELM) which fully inherits the merits of IEM-ELM. The performance of IEM-ELM and OSIEM-ELM are evaluated and compared with EM-ELM and OSEM-ELM respectively, and the experiments are carried out on three stock datasets, experimental results show that IEM-ELM and OSIEM-ELM produces better POCID performance than EM-ELM and OSEM-ELM at fast learning speed.

AB Distributed secure quantum machine learning (DSQML) enables a classical client with little quantum technology to delegate a remote quantum machine learning to the quantum server with the privacy data preserved. Moreover, DSQML can be extended to a more general case that the client does not have enough data, and resorts both the remote quantum server and remote databases to perform the secure machine learning. Here we propose a DSQML protocol that the client can classify two-dimensional vectors to different clusters, resorting to a remote small-scale photon quantum computation processor. The protocol is secure without leaking any relevant information to the Eve. Any eavesdropper who attempts to intercept and disturb the learning process can be noticed. In principle, this protocol can be used to classify high dimensional vectors and may provide a new viewpoint and application for future "big data". (C) 2017 Science China Press.

DE Visualization; Machine learning; Knowledge extraction
AB We describe a selection of challenges at the intersection of machine learning and data visualization and outline a subjective research agenda based on professional and personal experience. The unprecedented increase in the amount, variety and the value of data has been significantly transforming the way that scientific research is carried out and businesses operate. Within data science, which has emerged as a practice to enable this data-intensive innovation by gathering together and advancing the knowledge from fields such as statistics, machine learning, knowledge extraction, data management, and visualization, visualization plays a unique and maybe the ultimate role as an approach to facilitate the human and computer cooperation, and to particularly enable the analysis of diverse and heterogeneous data using complex computational methods where algorithmic results are challenging to interpret and operationalize. Whilst algorithm development is surely at the center of the whole pipeline in disciplines such as Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery, it is visualization which ultimately makes the results accessible to the end user. Visualization thus can be seen as a mapping from arbitrarily high-dimensional abstract spaces to the lower dimensions and plays a central and critical role in interacting with machine learning algorithms, and particularly in interactive machine learning (iML) with including the human-in-the-loop. The central goal of the CD-MAKE VIS workshop is to spark discussions at this intersection of visualization, machine learning and knowledge discovery and bring together experts from these disciplines. This paper discusses a perspective on the challenges and opportunities in this integration of these discipline and presents a number of directions and strategies for further research.

AB This paper proposes a novel method for supervised subspace learning based on Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Neural networks. The proposed method calculates appropriate network target vectors by formulating a Bayesian model exploiting both the labeling information available for the training data and geometric properties of the training data, when represented in the feature space determined by the network's hidden layer outputs. After the calculation of the network target vectors, Extreme Learning Machine-based neural network training is applied and classification is performed using a Nearest Neighbor classifier. Experimental results on publicly available data sets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the standard ELM approach, as well as other standard methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Emphasizing on feature extraction and classification, but ignoring order importance, is a general phenomenon in machine learning. Here, we first review the views on order in cognitive science briefly. Furthermore, a simple experiment on Yale database in face recognition is done to show the importance of order in machine learning. In the experiment, one kind of training sample set is randomly selected in one person's samples, but the ordinal of samples for different person is the same, while another kind of training sample set is completely randomly selected. The recognition performance using principal component analysis (PCA) on the first kind of set is significantly better than that on the second kind of set. This indicates the order's key role in machine learning, and it gives a new look on performance evaluation of previously published machine learning algorithms as well.

   markets
AB Trading in information markets, such as machine learning markets, has been shown to be an effective approach for aggregating the beliefs of different agents. In a machine learning context, aggregation commonly uses forms of linear opinion pools, or logarithmic (log) opinion pools. It is interesting to relate information market aggregation to the machine learning setting.
   In this paper we introduce a spectrum of compositional methods, Renyi divergence aggregators, that interpolate between log opinion pools and linear opinion pools. We show that these compositional methods are maximum entropy distributions for aggregating information from agents subject to individual biases, with the Renyi divergence parameter dependent on the bias. In the limit of no bias this reduces to the optimal limit of log opinion pools. We demonstrate this relationship practically on both simulated and real datasets.
   We then return to information markets and show that Renyi divergence aggregators are directly implemented by machine learning markets with isoelastic utilities, and so can result from autonomous self interested decision making by individuals contributing different predictors. The risk averseness of the isoelastic utility directly relates to the Renyi divergence parameter, and hence encodes how much an agent believes (s) he may be subject to an individual bias that could affect the trading outcome: if an agent believes (s) he might be acting on significantly biased information, a more risk averse isoelastic utility is warranted.

AB In this paper, we present a fast and accurate kernel-based supervised algorithm referred to as the Reduced Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (RKELM). In contrast to the work on Support Vector Machine (SVM) or Least Square SVM (LS-SVM), which identifies the support vectors or weight vectors iteratively, the proposed RKELM randomly selects a subset of the available data samples as support vectors (or mapping samples). By avoiding the iterative steps of SVM, significant cost savings in the training process can be readily attained, especially on Big datasets. RKELM is established based on the rigorous proof of universal learning involving reduced kernel-based SLFN. In particular, we prove that RKELM can approximate any nonlinear functions accurately under the condition of support vectors sufficiency. Experimental results on a wide variety of real world small instance size and large instance size applications in the context of binary classification, multi-class problem and regression are then reported to show that RKELM can perform at competitive level of generalized performance as the SVM/LS-SVM at only a fraction of the computational effort incurred.

AB In large-scale learning problem, the scalability of learning algorithms is usually the key factor affecting the algorithm practical performance, which is determined by both the time complexity of the learning algorithms and the amount of supervision information (i.e., labeled data). Learning with label proportions (LLP) is a new kind of machine learning problem which has drawn much attention in recent years. Different from the well-known supervised learning, LLP can estimate a classifier from groups of weakly labeled data, where only the positive/negative class proportions of each group are known. Due to its weak requirements for the input data, LLP presents a variety of real-world applications in almost all the fields involving anonymous data, like computer vision, fraud detection and spam filtering. However, even through the required labeled data is of a very small amount, LLP still suffers from the long execution time a lot due to the high time complexity of the learning algorithm itself. In this paper, we propose a very fast learning method based on inversing output scaling process and extreme learning machine, namely Inverse Extreme Learning Machine (IELM), to address the above issues. IELM can speed up the training process by order of magnitudes for large datasets, while achieving highly competitive classification accuracy with the existing methods at the same time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant speedup of the proposed method. We also demonstrate the feasibility of IELM with a case study in real-world setting: modeling image attributes based on ImageNet Object Attributes dataset.

AB Monotonic classification problems mean that both feature values and class labels are ordered and monotonicity relationships exist between some features and the decision label. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a single hidden layer feedforward neural network with fast training rate and good generalization capability, but due to the existence of training error, ELM cannot be directly used to handle monotonic classification problems. This work proposes a generalization of ELM for processing the monotonic classification, named as Monotonic Classification Extreme Learning Machine (MCELM) in which the monotonicity constraints are imposed to the original ELM model. Mathematically, MCELM is a quadratic programming problem in which the monotonicity relationships are considered as constraints and the training error is the objective to be minimized. The mathematical model of MCELM not only can make the generated classifier monotonic but also can minimize the classification error. MCELM does not need to tune parameters iteratively, and therefore, keeps the advantage of extremely fast training which is the essential characteristic of ELM. MCELM does not require that the monotonic relationships existing between features and the output are consistent, which essentially relaxes the assumption of consistent monotonicity used in most existing approaches to handling monotonic classification problems. In comparison with exiting approaches to handling monotonic classification, MCELM can indeed generate a monotonicity-reserving classifier which experimentally shows a much better generalization capability on both artificial and real world datasets.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Accurate fault diagnosis systems should consider both the historical performance and the assessment of the current state of a machine. Manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance are part of the machine's history and should be taken into account. The paper focuses on experimental procedures to develop a multi-criteria methodology to classify up to ten machine conditions. Using machine learning for signal processing techniques, any deviation from a normal steady state might be categorized as an abnormal behavior and, when demonstrated, a fault. To take advantage of machine learning algorithms, a significant amount of data is needed. To demonstrate the procedure the authors examined a synchronous machine. The authors recorded currents and voltages primarily, in stator and rotor winding, well as rotational speed and electromechanical torque. The collected signals were filtered and pre-processed, and to 5038 features were calculated and transformed into a tidy dataset. The sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm was used to extract the most important defined features. The results are shown in 3D scatter plots; in which each machine condition is represented. It is then possible to visualize the ability of the model to identify the most discriminant features. The same method can be used for the diagnostic of other types of machine conditions.

AB A machine learning approach for the operational situational awareness (OSA) in flight operations is presented. The spacecraft health and safety telemetry are generally time dependent and periodical. The machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, are used to capture the time dependent trend of the telemetry datasets characterized by their data patterns and noise level, which provides a direct insights into the health and safety status of telemetry datasets. As the time dependent trends are highly sensitive to changes above the noise level, the potential anomalies can be detected at much early stage, which leads to a more proactive flight operations and a more resilient system. The challenges for the machine-learning approach in the spacecraft ground system are to develop a systematic, accurate, adaptive and efficient data training strategy, and a representation to meet persistent requirement. The focus of this paper is to present a machine-learning approach for the time dependent trending of spacecraft datasets with arbitrary scales. The data training algorithms have been developed and implemented in neural networks, which are shown to generate highly accurate time dependent trend. The OSA tool, ASRC Intelligent Monitoring System (AIMS), is presented, which implements the machine-learning algorithm. The extensions of machine-learning algorithms in developing capabilities to improve the mission efficiency and enable more autonomous operations are discussed.

AB Machine learning, a powerful technique for building models, can rapidly provide accurate predictions. Since Integrated Circuit (IC) design and manufacturing have tremendously high complexity and enormous data, there is a surge in adapting machine learning approach in IC Design stages, as machine learning can provide fast predictions. Recently, machine learning has been used in some IC Design stages (e.g. Physical Verification), but not in Physical Design. In this research, machine learning is adapted to Physical Design. Surrogate Modeling is implemented to predict results after GR in Physical Design. Machine learning models for predicting Detailed Route (DR) results using Global Route (GR) results are also discussed. With surrogate models and machine learning methods, circuit performances after Physical Design (e.g. hold violation check and area) would be predicted quickly.

DE State estimation; Condition monitoring; Machine learning algorithms
AB The requirements concerning the technical availability as part of the overall equipment effectiveness increase constantly in production nowadays. Unplanned downtimes have to be prevented via efficient methods. Predictive, condition-based maintenance represents a valuable approach for fulfilling these demands, but precise models for state estimation are missing. From the manufacturers' point of view the challenge consists in wear models with the capability of specifying the correct component's state as well as providing reliable failure forecasts. Unfortunately, nowadays creation of wear models is based on specific stress tests or design of experiments from the manufacturer. The integration of the production phase or even data feedback and user knowledge does not take place. New potential is promised by cross-cutting technologies from ICT like cloud technologies-in general virtual platform concepts-or approaches of machine learning as enabling technologies. The objective of this paper is to adopt existing algorithms to the new application of condition monitoring in order to evaluate the applicability for automated training of robust wear models. In that context the most commonly used algorithms are described and the reader gets an impression what challenges have to be met when dealing with machine learning.

AB Class imbalance problem refers to unequal distribution of data instances between classes. Due to this, popular classifiers misclassify data instances of minority class into majority class. Initially, Extreme learning machine was proposed with the prime objective of handling real valued datasets. Though, it a fast learning technique, it suffers from the drawback of misclassification of imbalanced dataset which leads to the class imbalance problem. So, a new variant of ELM called Weighted Extreme Learning Machine was developed. This technique aimed at handling imbalance data by assigning more weight to minority class and less weight to majority class. The limitation of this technique lied in that it generates weight according to class distribution of training data, thereby, creating dependency on input data. This leads to the lack of finding optimal weight at which good generalization performance could be achieved. This work uses Genetic Algorithm to find optimal weight which is given to minority and majority class instances.

AB This paper proposes universal coarse-grained reconfigurable computing architecture for hardware implementation of decision trees (DTs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs), suitable for both field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) implementation. Using this universal architecture, two versions of DTs (functional DT and axis-parallel DT), two versions of SVMs (with polynomial and radial kernel) and two versions of ANNs (multi layer perceptron ANN and radial basis ANN) machine learning classifiers, have been implemented in FPGA. Experimental results, based on 18 benchmark datasets of standard UCI machine learning repository database, show that FPGA implementation provides significant improvement (1-2 orders of magnitude) in the average instance classification time, in comparison with software implementations based on R project.

AB As a novel learning algorithm for a single hidden-layer feedforward neural network, the extreme learning machine has attracted much research attention for its fast training speed and good generalization performances. Instead of iteratively tuning the parameters, the extreme machine can be seen as a linear optimization problem by randomly generating the input weights and hidden biases. However, the random determination of the input weights and hidden biases may bring non-optimal parameters, which have a negative impact on the final results or need more hidden nodes for the neural network. To overcome the above drawbacks caused by the non-optimal input weights and hidden biases, we propose a new hybrid learning algorithm named dolphin swarm algorithm extreme learning machine adopting the dolphin swarm algorithm to optimize the input weights and hidden biases efficiently. Each set of input weights and hidden biases is encoded into one vector, namely the dolphin. The dolphins are evaluated by root mean squared error and updated by the four pivotal phases of the dolphin swarm algorithm. Eventually, we will obtain an optimal set of input weights and hidden biases. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we compare the proposed algorithm with the standard extreme learning machine and three state-of-the-art methods, which are the particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine, evolutionary extreme learning machine, and self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine, under 13 benchmark datasets obtained from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior generalization performances than all the compared algorithms.

AB By incorporating prior knowledge in the form of implications into extreme learning machine (ELM), a novel knowledge-based extreme learning machine (KBELM) formulation is proposed in this work. In this approach, the nonlinear prior knowledge implications are converted into linear inequalities and are then included as linear equality constraints in the ELM formulation. The proposed KBELM formulation has the advantage that it leads to solving a system of linear equations. Effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on three synthetic and the publicly available Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer datasets by comparing their results with ELM and optimally pruned ELM using additive and radial basis function hidden nodes.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an efficient learning algorithm which can be easily used with least human intervene. But when ELM is applied as multiclass classifier, the results of some classes are not satisfactory and it's hard to adjust the parameters for these classes without affecting other classes. To overcome these limitations, a novel method is proposed. In proposed approach, binary ELM classifiers for each class are combined into an ensemble classifier using one-to-all strategy. The experiment on NSL-KDD data shows that the proposed approach outperforms ELM multiclass classifier, decision tree, neural network (NN) and support vector machines (SVM).

AB As very large studies of complex neuroimaging phenotypes become more common, human quality assessment of MRI-derived data remains one of the last major bottlenecks. Few attempts have so far been made to address this issue with machine learning. In this work, we optimize predictive models of quality for meshes representing deep brain structure shapes. We use standard vertex-wise and global shape features computed homologously across 19 cohorts and over 7500 human-rated subjects, training kernelized Support Vector Machine and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees classifiers to detect meshes of failing quality. Our models generalize across datasets and diseases, reducing human workload by 30-70%, or equivalently hundreds of human rater hours for datasets of comparable size, with recall rates approaching inter-rater reliability.

DE Game theory; Machine learning; Multioptimization
AB Machine learning is a discipline that deals with the study of algorithms that can learn from the data. Typically, these algorithms run by generating a model built from the observed data, and then employ the generated model to predict and make decisions. Most of the problems in machine learning could be translated to multi-objective optimization problems where multiple objectives have to be optimized at the same time in the presence of two or more conflicting objectives. Mapping multi-optimization problems to game theory can give stable solutions. This paper presents an introduction of game theory and collects the survey on how game theory is applied to some of the machine learning problems.

AB The Weibull distribution has historically been the Reliability Engineer's best tool for describing the probability of failures over time [1]. While this technique is very accurate at describing failure distributions for large populations of components, it works very poorly at predicting the time until failure of an individual component. The mean time until failure is often used to predict times until failure of individual components, but this value may vary greatly with actual times until failure.
   With the advent of machine learning techniques, the ability to learn from past behavior in order to predict future behavior makes it possible to predict an individual component's time until failure much more accurately. In this paper, we explore the predictive abilities of a machine learning technique to improve upon our ability to predict individual component times until failure in advance of actual failure. Once failure is predicted, an impending problem can be fixed before it actually occurs.
   This paper brings to light a machine learning approach for predicting individual component times until failure that we will show is far more accurate than the traditional MTBF approach. The algorithm built was able to monitor the health of 14 hardware samples and notify us of an impending failure well ahead of actual failure, providing adequate time to fix the problem before actual failure occurred.

AB Due to the significant efficiency and simple implementation, extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms enjoy much attention in regression and classification applications recently. Many efforts have been paid to enhance the performance of ELM from both methodology (ELM training strategies) and structure (incremental or pruned ELMs) perspectives. In this paper, a local coupled extreme learning machine (LC-ELM) algorithm is presented. By assigning an address to each hidden node in the input space, LC-ELM introduces a decoupler framework to ELM in order to reduce the complexity of the weight searching space. The activated degree of a hidden node is measured by the membership degree of the similarity between the associated address and the given input. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach works effectively and generally outperforms the original ELM in both regression and classification applications.

AB Solar energy, which is clean and renewable energy source, is a popular subject. The estimation of solar radiation can be done instead of long term measurements. Therefore, the satellite and meteorological values of 53 different locations of Turkey were used for estimations of solar radiation. In this study a hybrid approach was proposed. The train dataset was reduced by employing two times similarity and the reduced dataset was utilized with support vector machine to predict global solar radiation. Additionally, the proposed method was validated by employing neural network, linear regression, k nearest neighbor, extreme learning machine, Gaussian process regression and kernel smooth regression. This study was showed that the machine learning methods can be used instead of long term measurement before investments.

AB Over the last decade, deep belief neural networks have been a hot topic in machine learning. Such networks can perform a deep hierarchical representation of input data. The first layer can extract low-level features, the second layer can extract high-level features and so on. In general, deep belief neural network represents many-layered perceptron and permits to overcome some limitations of conventional multilayer perceptron due to deep architecture. In this work we propose a new training technique called Reconstruction Error-Based Approach (REBA) for deep belief neural network based on restricted Boltzmann machine. In contrast to classical Hinton's training approach, which is based on a linear training rule, the proposed technique is based on a nonlinear learning rule. We demonstrate the performance of REBA technique for the MNIST dataset visualization. The main contribution of this paper is a novel view on the training of a restricted Boltzmann machine.

AB The use of web 2.0 technologies in web based learning systems has made learning more learner-centered. In a learner centered environment, there is need to provide appropriate support to learners based on individual learner characteristics in order to maximize learning. This requires a Web-based learning system to have an adaptive interface to suit individual learner characteristics in order to accommodate diversity of learner needs and abilities and to maintain an appropriate context for interaction and for achieving personalized learning. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how machine learning techniques can provide adaptive learning support in a Web-based learning system. In this research, two machine learning algorithms namely: Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM) and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) were used. HVDM was used to determine those learners who were similar to the current learner while NBC was used to estimate the likelihood that the learner would need to use additional materials for the current concept. To demonstrate the concept we used a course in object oriented programming (OOP).

AB Polynomials have shown to be useful basis functions in the identification of nonlinear systems. However estimation of the unknown coefficients requires expensive algorithms, as for instance it occurs by applying an optimal least square approach. Bernstein polynomials have the property that the coefficients are the values of the function to be approximated at points in a fixed grid, thus avoiding a time-consuming training stage. This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to regression, based on new functions named particle-Bernstein polynomials, which is particularly suitable to solve multivariate regression problems. Several experimental results show the validity of the technique for the identification of nonlinear systems and the better performance achieved with respect to the standard techniques.

DE Deep learning; Restricted Boltzmann Machine; learning rate
AB Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) has been successfully applied to many different machine learning and pattern recognition problems. Usually, fixed learning rate (FLR) is used for training RBM. However, the reconstruction error (RCERR) with FLR may not be declined each iteration, which will result in a slow convergence speed. In this paper, we propose a method to dynamically choose the learning rate by reducing RCERR properly. The experiments on MNIST database and Caltech 101 Silhouettes database show the RBMs trained with dynamic learning rate (DLR) are better than that trained with FLR in classification accuracy and stability. It indicates DLR may be more suitable for training RBM.

AB Machine learning is one of the most popular field in the computer science having different types of techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and the various techniques which are lying under them, so in order to understand these different machine learning techniques a survey on these machine learning techniques has been done and tried to explain these few techniques. The machine learning techniques try to understand the different data sets which are given to the machine. The data which comes inside can be divided into two types i.e. labelled data and the unlabeled data. These have to tackle both of the data. Those techniques have been looked upon as well. Then the concept of outlier comes into picture. Outlier Detection is one of the major issues in Data Mining; to find an outlier from a group of patterns is a famous problem in data mining. A pattern which is dissimilar from all the remaining patterns is an outlier in the dataset. Earlier outliers were known as noisy data, now it has become very difficult in different areas of research. Finding an outlier is useful in detecting the data which can't be predicted and that which can't be identified. A number of surveys, research and review articles cover outlier detection techniques in great details. The paper discusses and it tries to explain some of the techniques which can help us in identifying or detecting the observation which show such kind of abnormal behavior, and in technical terms called as outlier detection techniques.

AB In this tutorial, we will provide an introduction to the main Python software tools used for applying machine learning techniques to medical data. The focus will be on open-source software that is freely available and is cross platform. To aid the learning experience, a companion GitHub repository is available so that you can follow the examples contained in this paper interactively using Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks will be more exhaustive than what is contained in this chapter, and will focus on medical datasets and healthcare problems. Briefly, this tutorial will first introduce Python as a language, and then describe some of the lower level, general matrix and data structure packages that are popular in the machine learning and data science communities, such as NumPy and Pandas. From there, we will move to dedicated machine learning software, such as SciKit-Learn. Finally we will introduce the Keras deep learning and neural networks library. The emphasis of this paper is readability, with as little jargon used as possible. No previous experience with machine learning is assumed. We will use openly available medical datasets throughout.

AB To analyze enormous datasets, collection of algorithms, associated systems and perform necessary processing on massive data structures there is obligation for a novel trend, which is framed by Big Data. Architecture of Big Data varies across compound machines and clusters with unique purpose sub systems. The data produced from several sources requires analysis and organization with meager amounts of time. To potentially speed up the processing, a unified way of machine learning is applied on MapReduce frame work. A broadly applicable programming model MapReduce is applied on different learning algorithms belonging to machine learning family for all business decisions. By using ML algorithms with Hadoop for better storage distribution will improve the time and processing speed. This paper presents parallel implementation of various machine learning algorithms implemented on top of MapReduce model for time and processing efficiency.

AB In this paper the more advanced, in comparison with traditional machine learning approaches, deep learning methods are explored with the purpose of accurately predicting the aggregated energy consumption. Despite the fact that a wide range of machine learning methods have been applied to probabilistic energy prediction, the deep learning ones certainly represent the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods with remarkable success in a spectrum of practical applications. In particular, the use of Multi Layer Perceptrons, recently enhanced with deep learning capabilities, is proposed. Furthermore, its performance is compared with the most commonly used machine learning methods, such as Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Processes, Regression Trees, Ensemble Boosting and Linear Regression. The analysis of the day-ahead energy prediction demonstrates that different prediction methods present significantly different levels of accuracy in the case of a challenging dataset that comprises an interesting mix of consumers, wind and solar generation. The results show that Multi Layer Perceptrons outperform all the eight methods used as a benchmark in this study.

AB In spite of the recent advancement of machine learning research, modern machine learning systems are still far from easy to use, at least from the perspective of business users or even scientists without a computer science background. Recently, there is a trend toward pushing machine learning onto the cloud as a "service," a.k.a. machine learning clouds. By putting a set of machine learning primitives on the cloud, these services significantly raise the level of abstraction for machine learning. For example, with Amazon Machine Learning, users only need to upload the dataset and specify the type of task (classification or regression). The cloud will then train machine learning models without any user intervention.

AB In this study we apply machine learning techniques to Modeling Golf Player Skill using a dataset consisting of 277 golfers. The dataset includes 28 quantitative metrics, related to the club head at impact and ball flight, captured using a Doppler-radar. For modeling, cost-sensitive decision trees and random forest are used to discern between less skilled players and very good ones, i.e., Hackers and Pros. The results show that both random forest and decision trees achieve high predictive accuracy, with regards to true positive rate, accuracy and area under the ROC-curve. A detailed interpretation of the decision trees shows that they concur with modern swing theory, e.g., consistency is very important, while face angle, club path and dynamic loft are the most important evaluated swing factors, when discerning between Hackers and Pros. Most of the Hackers could be identified by a rather large deviation in one of these values compared to the Pros. Hackers, which had less variation in these aspects of the swing, could instead be identified by a steeper swing plane and a lower club speed. The importance of the swing plane is an interesting finding, since it was not expected and is not easy to explain.

For this project, we explored teaching strategies for introducing machine learning topics to non-technical students in discipline-relevant ways, culminating in a large collection of ready-to-use learning modules suitable for use in a wide variety of academic fields. We present a roadmap to our online repository of module materials, a detailed walk-thru of the contents of an example module, ideas and approaches for incorporating modules into a class or assisting non-technical colleagues in doing the same, and a summary of results of using these modules in course settings.

AB This paper describes the Blizzard Machine Learning Challenge (BMLC) 2017, which is a spin-off of the Blizzard Challenge. The annual Blizzard Challenges 2005-2017 were held to better understand and compare research techniques in building corpus-based text-to-speech (TTS) systems on the same data. The series of Blizzard Challenges has helped us measure progress in TTS technology. However, to get competitive performance, a lot time has to be spent on skilled tasks. This may make the Blizzard Challenge unattractive to machine learning researchers from other fields. Therefore, we recommend that the BMLC not involve these speech-specific tasks and that it allow participants to concentrate on the acoustic modeling task, framed as a straightforward machine learning problem, with a fixed dataset. In the BMLC 2017, two types of datasets consisting of four hours of speech data suitable for machine learning problems were distributed. This paper summarizes the purpose, design, and whole process of the challenge and its results.

AB A multi-graph is represented by a bag of graphs and modelled as a generalization of a multi-instance. Multi-graph classification is a supervised learning problem for multi-graph, which has a wide range of applications, such as scientific publication categorization, bio-pharmaceu-tical activity tests and online product recommendation. However, existing algorithms are limited to process small datasets due to high computation complexity of multi-graph classification. Specially, the precision is not high enough for a large dataset. In this paper, we propose a scalable and high-precision parallel algorithm to handle the multi-graph classification problem on massive datasets using MapReduce and extreme learning machine. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic graph datasets show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient.

AB Machine learning algorithms are computer programs that try to predict cancer type based on the past data. The eventual goal of Machine learning algorithms in cancer diagnosis is to have a trained machine learning algorithm that gives the gene expression levels from cancer patient, can accurately predict what type and severity of cancer they have, aiding the doctor in treating it. The existing technology compares three different machine learning algorithms are Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Bayesian Belief Network. The main drawback of these algorithms is unusual because the number of features (gene expressions) far exceeds the number of cases (samples taken from patients). Performance efficiency can be achieved by comparing two more algorithms are Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms. Because Random forest and Naive Bayes are used as feature selection method, Random Forest is used to rank the feature importance and applied for relevant feedback. The requirements are weka tool, Java and Relational Database.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB This paper describes an extended machine learning approach to classify legal norms in German statutory texts. We implemented an active machine learning (AML) framework based on open-source software. Within the paper we discuss different query strategies to optimize the selection of instances during the learning phase to decrease the required training data.
   The approach was evaluated within the domain of tenancy law. Thereby, we manually labeled the 532 sentences into eight different functional types and achieved an average F1 score of 0.74. Comparing three different classifiers and four query strategies the classification performance F1 varies from 0.60 to 0.93. We could show that in norm classification tasks AML is more efficient than conventional supervised machine learning approaches.

AB This paper presents a method based on extreme learning machine to learn motions from human demonstrations. We model a motion as an autonomous dynamical system and define sufficient conditions to ensure the global stability at the target. A detailed theoretic analysis is proposed on the constraints regarding to input and output weights which yields a globally stable reproduction of demonstrations. We solve the corresponding optimization problem using nonlinear programming and evaluate it on an available data set and a real robot. Combined with the generalization capacities of extreme learning machine, the results show that the human movement strategies within demonstrations can be generalized well.

AB This paper explores the application of a Machine Vision and Machine Learning Algorithm to a Manipulator with six degrees of freedom (6-DOF). A Kinect sensor were used to extract images from a screen and obtain the relevant target information. Image processing was accomplished using a Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) Algorithm to capture image of the target object. The processed visual is rendered on the computer controller and Manipulator Learning is accomplished using a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm. Markov Decision Processes (MDP) were used to train the Manipulator to move to the location of the target object. Experimental results showed the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm proposed in this paper is effective and can be utilized on a 6-DOF Manipulator with reproducible results.

AB The application of machine learning to quantum information processing has recently attracted keen interest, particularly for the optimization of control parameters in quantum tasks without any pre-programmed knowledge. By adapting the machine learning technique, we present a novel protocol in which an arbitrarily initialized device at a learner's location is taught by a provider located at a distant place. The protocol is designed such that any external learner who attempts to participate in or disrupt the learning process can be prohibited or noticed. We numerically demonstrate that our protocol works faithfully for single-qubit operation devices. A trade-off between the inaccuracy and the learning time is also analyzed.

ID TRAINING DATA; LABEL NOISE; CLASSIFICATION
AB A lot of data sets, gathered for instance during user experiments, are contaminated with noise. Some noise in the measured features is not much of a problem, it even increases the performance of many Machine Learning (ML) techniques. But for noise in the labels (mislabeled data) the situation is quite different, label noise deteriorates the performance of all ML techniques. The research question addressed in this paper is to what extent can one detect mislabeled data using a committee of supervised Machine Learning models. The committee under consideration consists of a Bayesian model, Random Forest, Logistic classifier, a Neural Network and a Support Vector Machine. This committee is applied to a given data set in several iterations of 5-fold Cross validation. If a data sample is misclassified by all committee members in all iterations (consensus) then it is tagged as mislabeled. This approach was tested on the Iris plant data set, which is artificially contaminated with mislabeled data. For this data set the precision of detecting mislabeled samples is 100% and the recall is approximately 5%. The approach was also tested on the Touch data set, a data set of naturalistic social touch gestures. It is known that this data set contains mislabeled data, but the amount is unknown. For this data set the proposed method achieved a precision of 70% and for almost all other tagged samples the corresponding touch gesture deviated a lot from the prototypical touch gesture. Overall the proposed method shows high potential for detecting mislabeled samples, but the precision on other data sets needs to be investigated.

AB In many practical engineering applications, data tend to be collected in online sequential way with imbalanced class. Many traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machine and so on generally get biased classifier which leads to lower classification precision for minor class than major class. To get fast and efficient classification, a new online sequential extreme learning machine method with two-stage hybrid strategy is proposed. In offline stage, data-based strategy is employed, and the principal curve is introduced to model the distribution of minority class data. In online stage, algorithm-based strategy is employed, and a new leave-one-out cross-validation method using Sherman-Morrison matrix inversion lemma is proposed to tackle online imbalance data, meanwhile, with add-delete mechanism for updating network weights. The proposed method is evaluated on the real-world Macau air pollutant forecasting dataset. The experimental results show that, the proposed method outperforms the classical ELM, OS-ELM and metacognitive OS-ELM in terms of generalization performance and numerical stability.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) proposed by Huang et al. is a learning algorithm for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). ELM has the advantage of fast learning speed and high efficiency, so it brought into public focus. Later someone developed regularized extreme learning machine (RELM) and extreme learning machine with kernel (KELM). But they are the single-hidden layer network structure, so they have deficient in feature extraction. Deep learning (DL) is a multilayer network structure, and it can extract the significant features by learning from a lower layer to a higher layer. As DL mostly uses the gradient descent method, it will spend too much time in the process of adjusting parameters. This paper proposed a novel model of convolutional extreme learning machine with kernel (CKELM) which was based on DL for solving problems-KELM is deficient in feature extraction, and DL spends too much time in the training process. In CKELM model, alternate convolutional layers and subsampling layers add to hidden layer of the original KELM so as to extract features and classify. The convolutional layer and subsampling layer do not use the gradient algorithm to adjust parameters because of some architectures yielded good performance with random weights. Finally, we took experiments on USPS and MNIST database. The accuracy of CKELM is higher than ELM, RELM and KELM, which proved the validity of the optimization model. To make the proposed approach more convincing, we compared with other ELM-based methods and other DL methods and also achieved satisfactory results.

DE Mesh networks; Machine learning; Forwarding; Highest bandwidth capacity
AB Wireless Mesh Networks improve their capacities by equipping mesh nodes with multi-radios tuned to non-overlapping channels. Hence the data forwarding between two nodes has multiple selections of links and the bandwidth between the pair of nodes varies dynamically. Under this condition, a mesh node adopts machine learning mechanisms to choose the possible best next hop which has maximum bandwidth when it intends to forward data. In this paper, we present a machine learning based forwarding algorithm to let a forwarding node dynamically select the next hop with highest potential bandwidth capacity to resume communication based on learning algorithm. Key to this strategy is that a node only maintains three past status, and then it is able to learn and predict the potential bandwidth capacities of its links. Then, the node selects the next hop with potential maximal link bandwidth. Moreover, a geometrical based algorithm is developed to let the source node figure out the forwarding region in order to avoid flooding. Simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly speeds up the transmission and outperforms other peer algorithms.

AB In this paper, the brief survey of data mining classification by using the machine learning techniques is presented. The machine learning techniques like decision tree and support vector machine play the important role in all the applications of artificial intelligence. Decision tree works efficiently with discrete data and SVM is capable of building the nonlinear boundaries among the classes. Both of these techniques have their own set of strengths which makes them suitable in almost all classification tasks.

AB For learning in big datasets, the classification performance of ELM might be low due to input samples are not extracted features properly. To address this problem, the hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) framework was proposed based on the hierarchical learning architecture of multilayer perceptron. H-ELM composes of two parts; the first is the unsupervised multilayer encoding part and the second part is the supervised feature classification part. H-ELM can give higher accuracy rate than of the traditional ELM. However, it still has to enhance its classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method namely as the extending hierarchical extreme learning machine (EH-ELM). For the extended supervisor part of EH-ELM, we have got an idea from the twolayers extreme learning machine. To evaluate the performance of EH-ELM, three different image datasets; Semeion, MNIST, and NORB, were studied. The experimental results show that EH-ELM achieves better performance than of H-ELM and the other multi-layer framework.

AB Machine learning is one of the most important fields in recent improvement in big data analysis. Many people apply machine learning for a variety of domains for various purposes, such as classification of opinions. However, the constructed models of machine learning are black boxes. They cannot understand the background reason for their decisions. In many cases, understanding the reasons important. In this paper, we focus on interpretation of models and understanding of decision reasons. First, we introduce the results of an opinions classification of the reviews with Support Vector Machine (SVM). Second, we interpret the model by analyzing weights of the model. Third, we introduce a method for helping to understand the reasons for a decision by SVM by providing a simplified information of the highly weighted words.

ID GLUCOSE
AB Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are widely used for collecting and monitoring patients' vital healthcare parameters, such as breathing, heart function and muscle activity. A serious flaw of WBANs is their vulnerability to various security issues, one of which is the physical tampering of the sensors. Transmission of invalid data by a damaged or compromised sensor may lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper treatment and undesirable results. In this paper, we analyze blood glucose-level sensors and propose a machine learning algorithm that detects intentional and inadvertent data modification intrusions for this type of sensors. The proposed algorithm uses Otsu's Thresholding Method and other statistical measures to create features that estimate boundaries, averages, deviations and patterns of sensor data. Feature vectors are then classified by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel and varying misclassification parameter. Experiments on a large real-patient dataset show that the proposed algorithm achieves 100% precision and 99.22% recall.

DE Machine learning process; dataflow; directed acyclic graph
AB Machine learning algorithms have become the key components in many big data applications. However, the full potential of machine learning is still far from been realized because using machine learning algorithms is hard, especially on distributed platforms such as Hadoop and Spark [8]. The key barriers come from not only the implementation of the algorithms themselves, but also the processing for applying them to real applications which often involve multiple steps and different algorithms. In this demo we present a general-purpose dataflow-based system for easing the process of applying machine learning algorithms to real world tasks. In the system, a learning task is formulated as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which each node represents an operation (e.g., a machine learning algorithm), and each edge represents the flow of the data from one node to its descendants. Graphical user interface is implemented for making users to create, configure, submit, and monitor a task in a drag-and-drop manner. Advantages of the system include 1) lowering the barriers of defining and executing machine learning tasks; 2) sharing and re-using the implementations of the algorithms, the task dataflow DAGs, and the (intermediate) experimental results; 3) seamlessly integrating the stand-alone algorithms as well as the distributed algorithms in one task. The system has been deployed as a machine learning service and can be access from the Internet.

ID VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; ENSEMBLE
AB The Big Data revolution promises to transform how we live, work, and think by enabling process optimization, empowering insight discovery and improving decision making. The realization of this grand potential relies on the ability to extract value from such massive data through data analytics; machine learning is at its core because of its ability to learn from data and provide data driven insights, decisions, and predictions. However, traditional machine learning approaches were developed in a different era, and thus are based upon multiple assumptions, such as the data set fitting entirely into memory, what unfortunately no longer holds true in this new context. These broken assumptions, together with the Big Data characteristics, are creating obstacles for the traditional techniques. Consequently, this paper compiles, summarizes, and organizes machine learning challenges with Big Data. In contrast to other research that discusses challenges, this work highlights the cause effect relationship by organizing challenges according to Big Data Vs or dimensions that instigated the issue: volume, velocity, variety, or veracity. Moreover, emerging machine learning approaches and techniques are discussed in terms of how they are capable of handling the various challenges with the ultimate objective of helping practitioners select appropriate solutions for their use cases. Finally, a matrix relating the challenges and approaches is presented. Through this process, this paper provides a perspective on the domain, identifies research gaps and opportunities, and provides a strong foundation and encouragement for further research in the field of machine learning with Big Data.

SO MACHINE LEARNING

DE Memory virtualization; Support vector machines; Transfer
AB Virtualization is an essential technology in data centers allowing for a single machine to be used for multiple applications or users. With memory virtualization, two approaches, shadow paging (SP) and hardware-assisted paging (HAP), are taken by modern virtual machine memory managers. Neither memory mode is always preferred; previous studies have proposed to exploit the advantages of both modes by dynamically switching between these two paging modes based on the on-the-fly system behavior. However, the existing scheme makes the switching decision based on manual rules summarized for a specific architecture. This paper employs a machine learning approach that learns a decision model automatically and thus can adapt to different systems. Experimental results show that the performance of our switching mechanism can match or outperform either SP or HAP alone. Also, the results demonstrate that a machine learning-based decision model can match the performance of the hand-tuned model. Moreover, we further show that different hardware/software settings can affect on-the-fly system behavior and thus demand different decision models. Our scheme yields two effective decision models on two different machines. Additionally, transfer learning was used in order to efficiently train a model when faced with a new hardware configuration with only a limited number of training samples from the new machine.

In the learning theory framework, inductive bias provides a powerful tool, and allows one to shape the generalization properties of a learning machine. The paper formalizes semi-supervised learning as a supervised learning problem biased by an unsupervised reference solution. The resulting semi-supervised classification framework can apply any clustering algorithm to derive the reference function, thus ensuring maximum flexibility. In this context, the paper derives the biased version of Extreme Learning Machine (br-ELM). The experimental session involves several real world problems and proves the reliability of the semi-supervised classification scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FORGETTING FACTOR; ALGORITHM
AB Online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) is an online learning algorithm training single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), which can learn data one-by-one or chunk-by-chunk with fixed or varying data size. Due to its characteristics of online sequential learning, OS-ELM is popularly used to solve time-series prediction problem, such as stock forecast, weather forecast, passenger count forecast, etc. OS-ELM, however, has two fatal drawbacks: Its input weights cannot be adjusted and it cannot be applied to learn recurrent neural network (RNN). Therefore we propose a modified version of OS-ELM, called online recurrent extreme learning machine (OR-ELM), which is able to adjust input weights and can be applied to learn RNN, by applying ELM-auto-encoder and a normalization method called layer normalization (LN). Proposed method is used to solve a time-series prediction problem on NewYork City passenger count dataset, and the results show that R-ELM outperforms OS-ELM and other online-sequential learning algorithms such as hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) and online long short-term memory (online LSTM).

AB Minimal Learning Machine (MLM) is a recently proposed supervised learning algorithm with performance comparable to most state-of-the-art machine learning methods. In this work, we propose ensemble methods for classification and regression using MLMs. The goal of ensemble strategies is to produce more robust and accurate models when compared to a single classifier or regression model. Despite its successful application, MLM employs a computationally intensive optimization problem as part of its test procedure (out-of-sample data estimation). This becomes even more noticeable in the context of ensemble learning, where multiple models are used. Aiming to provide fast alternatives to the standard MLM, we also propose the Nearest Neighbor Minimal Learning Machine and the Cubic Equation Minimal Learning Machine to cope with classification and single-output regression problems, respectively. The experimental assessment conducted on real-world datasets reports that ensemble of fast MLMs perform comparably or superiorly to reference machine learning algorithms.

AB The Web is a popular, easy and common way to propagate information today and according to the growth of the Web, Web service discovery has become a challenging task. Clustering Web services into similar clusters through calculating the semantic similarity of Web services is one way for overcome this issue. Several methods are used for current similarity calculation process such as knowledge based, information-retrieval based, text mining, ontology based and context-aware based methods. Through this paper, present a method for calculating Web service similarity using both ontology learning and machine learning that uses a support vector machine for similarity calculation in generated ontology instead of edge count base method. Experimental results show that our hybrid approach of combining ontology learning and machine learning works efficiently and give accurate results than previous two approaches.

AB Usually, the solution of the conventional extreme learning machine, which is a type of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks, is not sparse.
   In this paper, to overcome this problem, we discuss a sparse extreme learning machine using empirical feature mapping. Here, the basis vectors of empirical feature space are the linearly independent training vectors. Then, unlike the conventional extreme learning machine, only these linearly independent training vectors become support vectors. Hence, the solution of the proposed method is sparse. Using UCI bench-mark datasets, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the conventional methods from the standpoints of the sparsity and classification capability.

AB While neural machine translation (NMT) is making good progress in the past two years, tens of millions of bilingual sentence pairs are needed for its training. However, human labeling is very costly. To tackle this training data bottleneck, we develop a dual-learning mechanism, which can enable an NMT system to automatically learn from unlabeled data through a dual-learning game. This mechanism is inspired by the following observation: any machine translation task has a dual task, e.g., English-to-French translation (primal) versus French-to-English translation (dual); the primal and dual tasks can form a closed loop, and generate informative feedback signals to train the translation models, even if without the involvement of a human labeler. In the dual-learning mechanism, we use one agent to represent the model for the primal task and the other agent to represent the model for the dual task, then ask them to teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. Based on the feedback signals generated during this process (e.g., the language-model likelihood of the output of a model, and the reconstruction error of the original sentence after the primal and dual translations), we can iteratively update the two models until convergence (e.g., using the policy gradient methods). We call the corresponding approach to neural machine translation dual-NMT. Experiments show that dual-NMT works very well on English <-> French translation; especially, by learning from monolingual data (with 10% bilingual data for warm start), it achieves a comparable accuracy to NMT trained from the full bilingual data for the French-to-English translation task.

AB The use of machine learning algorithms has increased in a wide variety of domains (from finance to biocomputing and astronomy), and nowadays has a significant impact on the geoscience community. In most real cases geoscience data modelling problems are multivariate, high dimensional, variable at several spatial scales, and are generated by non-linear processes. For such complex data, the spatial prediction of continuous (or categorical) variables is a challenging task. The aim of this paper is to investigate the potential of the recently developed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for environmental data analysis, modelling and spatial prediction purposes. An important contribution of this study deals with an application of a generic self-consistent methodology for environmental data driven modelling based on Extreme Learning Machine. Both real and simulated data are used to demonstrate applicability of ELM at different stages of the study to understand and justify the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Identification and classification of graph data is a hot research issue in pattern recognition. The conventional methods of graph classification usually convert the graph data to vector representation which ignore the sparsity of graph data. In this paper, we propose a new graph classification algorithm called graph classification based on sparse graph feature selection and extreme learning machine. The key of our method is using lasso to select sparse feature because of the sparsity of the corresponding feature space of the graph data, and extreme learning machine (ELM) is introduced to the following classification task due to its good performance. Extensive experimental results on a series of benchmark graph datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB The paper addresses the role of randomization in the training process of a learning machine, and analyses the affinities between two well-known schemes, namely, Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and the learning framework using similarity functions. These paradigms share a common approach to inductive learning, which combines an explicit remapping of data with a linear separator; however, they seem to exploit different strategies in the design of the mapping layer. The paper shows that, in fact, the theory of learning with similarity functions can stimulate a novel interpretation of the ELM paradigm, thus leading to a common framework. New insights into the ELM model are obtained, and the ELM strategy for the setup of the neurons' parameters can be significantly improved. Experimental results confirm that the novel method improves over conventional approaches, especially in the trade-off between classification accuracy and machine complexity (i.e., the dimensionality of the remapped space). This, in turn, supports the reliability of the unified framework envisioned in this paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Object grasping using vision is one of the important functions of manipulators. Machine learning based methods have been proposed for grasp detection. However, due to the variety of grasps and 3D shapes of objects, how to effectively find the best grasp is still a challenging issue. Thus this paper presents an extreme learning machine (ELM) based method to cope with this issue. This proposed method consists of three successive modules, including candidate object detection, estimation of object's major orientations and grasp detection. In the first module, candidate object region is extracted based on depth information. In the second module, object's major orientations guide the directions for sliding windows. In the third module, a cascaded classifier is trained to identify the right grasp. ELM is used as the base classifier in the cascade. Histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) are used as features. Experimental results in benchmark dataset and real manipulators have shown that this proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB We explored supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to understand and predict the adequacy and fluency of English-Spanish machine translation. Five experiments were conducted using three classifiers in Weka, an open-source ML tool. We found that the highest performance was achieved by applying a dimensionality reduction approach to the classification task, which included collapsing a numeric scale of quality to two categories: high quality and low quality. Our results showed that the Support Vector Machine classifier performed the best at predicting the adequacy (65.65%) and fluency (65.77%) of the translations. More research is needed to explore the methodologies of applying ML to translation evaluation.

ID REGRESSION
AB With growth of data sets, the efficiency of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model combined with accustomed hardware implementation such as Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) became attractive for many real-time learning tasks. In order to reduce resource occupation in eventual trained model on FPGA, it is more efficient to store fixed-point data rather than double-floating data in the on-chip RAMs. This paper conducts the fixed-point evaluation of ELM for classification. We converted the ELM algorithm into a fixed-point version by changing the operation type, approximating the complex function and blocking the large-scale matrixes, according to the architecture ELM would be implemented on FPGA. The performance of classification with single bit-width and mixed bit-width were evaluated respectively. Experimental results show that the fixed-point representation used on ELM does work for some application, while the performance could be better if we adopt mixed bit-width.

ID REGRESSION
AB Interval data offer a valuable way of representing the available information in complex problems where uncertainty, inaccuracy, or variability must be taken into account. Considered in this paper is the learning of interval neural networks, of which the input and output are vectors with interval components, and the weights are real numbers. The back-propagation (BP) learning algorithm is very slow for interval neural networks, just as for usual real-valued neural networks. Extreme learning machine (ELM) has faster learning speed than the BP algorithm. In this paper, ELM is applied for learning of interval neural networks, resulting in an interval extreme learning machine (IELM). There are two steps in the ELM for usual feed-forward neural networks. The first step is to randomly generate the weights connecting the input and the hidden layers, and the second step is to use the Moore-Penrose generalized inversely to determine the weights connecting the hidden and output layers. The first step can be directly applied for interval neural networks. But the second step cannot, due to the involvement of nonlinear constraint conditions for IELM. Instead, we use the same idea as that of the BP algorithm to form a nonlinear optimization problem to determine the weights connecting the hidden and output layers of IELM. Numerical experiments show that IELM is much faster than the usual BP algorithm. And the generalization performance of IELM is much better than that of BP, while the training error of IELM is a little bit worse than that of BP, implying that there might be an over-fitting for BP.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) techniques have received considerable attention in the computational intelligence and machine learning communities because of the significantly low computational time required for training new classifiers. ELM provides solutions for regression, clustering, binary classification, multiclass classifications and so on, but not for multi-label learning. Multi-label learning deals with objects having multiple labels simultaneously, which widely exist in real-world applications. Therefore, a thresholding method-based ELM is proposed in this paper to adapt ELM to multi-label classification, called extreme learning machine for multi-label classification (ELM-ML). ELM-ML outperforms other multi-label classification methods in several standard data sets in most cases, especially for applications which only have a small labeled data set.

AB Management of legal contracts in various business domains such as Real Estate are examples of typical business process outsourcing activity. One of such process is Lease Abstraction, where largely manual inspection and validation of large commercial lease documents made for real estate deals is done by offshore experts and relevant information from the documents is extracted into a structured form. This structured information is further used for aggregate analytics and decision making by large real estate firms. We propose a system based on machine learning techniques to semi automate this process, essentially leading to 50% human effort savings. Our approach weaves together state-of-the-art machine learning techniques like supervised classifier models, sequence modeling techniques and various semi-supervised approaches. We articulate the effectiveness of our solution using the results from the experiments. Our platform is being used in production environment by Accenture Operations and the initial results and user feedback are encouraging.

AB An accurate image classification system often requires many labeled training instances to train the classification models, which is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, machine learning technologies which could utilize unlabeled instances to promote classification accuracy attract more attentions in the image classification field. Active learning and semi-supervised learning could both automatically discovery the hidden useful information from unlabeled instances. In this article, we try to combine active learning and semi-supervised learning to improve the classification performance of multi-class images. Specifically, extreme learning machine (ELM) is adopted as baseline classifier to accelerate the learning procedure, and an uncertainty estimation strategy is used to evaluate the information of each unlabeled instance. The experimental results on five multi-class image data sets show that the proposed method outperforms both random sampling and active learning. Meanwhile, we found that contrast with support vector machine (SVM), ELM could save much training time without obvious loss of performance.

AB While explanations may help people learn by providing information about why an answer is correct, many problems on online platforms lack high'-quality explanations. This paper presents AXIS (Adaptive eXplanation Improvement System), a system for obtaining explanations. AXIS asks learners to generate, revise, and evaluate explanations as they solve a problem, and then uses machine learning to dynamically determine which explanation to present to a future learner, based on previous learners' collective input. Results from a case study deployment and a randomized experiment demonstrate that AXIS elicits and identifies explanations that learners find helpful. Providing explanations from AXIS also objectively enhanced learning, when compared to the default practice where learners solved problems and received answers without explanations. The rated quality and learning benefit of AXIS explanations did not differ from explanations generated by an experienced instructor.

AB Supervised classification of quad-polarimetric SAR images is often constrained by the availability of reliable training samples. Active learning (AL) provides a unique capability at selecting samples with high representation quality and low redundancy. The most important part of AL is the criterion for selecting the most informative candidates (pixels) by ranking. In this paper, class supports based on the posterior probability function are approximated by ensemble learning and majority voting. This approximation is statistically meaningful when a large enough classifier ensemble is exploited. In this work, we propose to use extreme learning machines and apply AL to quad-polarimetric SAR image classification. Extreme learning machines are ideal because of their fast operation, straightforward solution and strong generalization. As inputs to the so-called active extreme learning machines, both polarimetric and spatial features (morphological profiles) are considered. In order to validate the proposed method, results and performance are compared with random sampling and state-of-the-art AL methods, such as margin sampling, normalized entropy query-by-bagging and multiclass level uncertainty. Experimental results for four quad-polarimetric SAR images collected by RADARSAT-2, AirSAR and EMISAR indicate that the proposed method achieves promising results in different scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method is faster than existing techniques in both the learning and the classification phases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE cardiotocography; machine learning techniques; classification
AB Cardiotocography is a monitoring technique providing important and vital information on fetal status during antepartum and intrapartum periods. The advances in modern obstetric practice allowed many robust and reliable machine learning techniques to be utilized in classifying fetal heart rate signals. The role of machine learning approaches in diagnosing diseases is becoming increasingly essential and intertwined. The main aim of the present study is to determine the most efficient machine learning technique to classify fetal heart rate signals. Therefore, the research has been focused on the widely used and practical machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, extreme learning machine, radial basis function network, and random forest. In a comparative way, fetal heart rate signals were classified as normal or hypoxic using the aforementioned machine learning techniques. The performance metrics derived from confusion matrix were used to measure classifiers' success. According to experimental results, although all machine learning techniques produced satisfactory results, artificial neural network yielded the rather well results with the sensitivity of 99.73% and specificity of 97.94%. The study results show that the artificial neural network was superior to other algorithms.

AB Indoor systems cannot obtain a precise estimate of the location, due to unstable signals. In this paper, we use realistic wireless data from the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) dataset and Azure Machine Learning Studio to perform Bagging (also called bootstrap aggregating). By using the machine leaning technique in the Azure Machine Learning Studio, we can obtain more than 69 percent precision in identifying the correct area among 247 areas with only 505 training data. This result is equivalent to the second place entry in the IEEE ICDM Data Mining Contest. We show that this can achieve a highly accurate location estimation.

AB Remote sensing image classification is a very challenging problem and covariance descriptor can be introduced in the feature extraction process for remote sensing image. However, covariance descriptor lies in non-Euclidean manifold, and conventional extreme learning machine (ELM) cannot effectively deal with this problem. In this paper, we propose an improved ELM framework incorporating the collaborative coding to tackle the covariance descriptor classification problem. First, a new ELM-guided dictionary learning and coding model is proposed to represent the covariance descriptor. Then the iterative optimization algorithm is developed to solve the model. By evaluating the proposed approach on the public dataset, we show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB Ensuring energy efficiency in data centers is a crucial objective in modern cloud computing because it reduces operating costs and complies with the goals of green computing. Researchers strive to develop optimal policies for resource management in the cloud, which has many components such as virtual machine placement, task scheduling, workload consolidation, and so on. Machine learning has a major role to play in these efforts. In this paper, we provide a detailed survey of recent works in the literature which have employed machine learning (ML) to offer solutions for energy efficiency in cloud computing environments. We also present a comparative classification of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we enrich this survey by studying non-ML proposals to energy conservation in data centers, and also how ML has been applied towards other objectives in the cloud.

AB Modern water distribution networks are equipped with a large amount of sensors to monitor the drinking water quality. To detect anomalies, usually each sensor contains its own threshold, but machine-learning algorithms become an alternative to reduce the parametrization effort. Still, one reason why they are not used in practice is the geographical restricted data access. Data is stored at the plant, but data scientists needed for the data analysis are situated elsewhere.
   To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based event-detection and reporting platform, which provides a possibility to use machine learning algorithms. The plant's measurements are cyclically transferred into a secure cloud service where they are downloaded and analyzed from the data scientist. Results are made available as reports.

AB In this article, an integrative approach for augmenting the segmentation capabilities of the off-line trained Machine Learning (ML) classifier is presented. The proposed approach augments the ML performance in the graph cut setup. The integration of the prediction capabilities of the classifiers and neighborhood relationship of the pixels result in increase of segmentation performance. The experimental setup includes an evaluation of the Bayesian Network, Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest and the Histogram approach of Jones and Rehg [1]. The evaluation results based on the color based detection dataset reveal that the proposed integrative approach improves the detection performance compared to using the off-line classifiers alone.

AB Machine learning is an ideal tool for extracting the hidden patterns in the data and making efficient predictions on the same. One of the primary advantages of this paradigm is the minimal dependency on the human factors that make it to deliver its best among disparate and wide variety of sources. It is powered by data running at the machine scale. It is best when the the data is to be dealt with is large in volume, high in speed and diverse in variety. And unlike conventional analysis of data, machine learning thrives with growing data. The more data is entered into a machine, the more it can learn and apply the results for advanced quality insights. The aim of this paper is to present a comparative analysis of the Machine Learning algorithms to best reconcile Big Data challenges drawn on the basis of optimized performance with respect to time and accuracy obtained in prediction.

AB This review presents and discusses the contribution of machine learning techniques for diagnosis and disease monitoring in the context of clinical vision science. Many ocular diseases leading to blindness can be halted or delayed when detected and treated at its earliest stages. With the recent developments in diagnostic devices, imaging and genomics, new sources of data for early disease detection and patients' management are now available. Machine learning techniques emerged in the biomedical sciences as clinical decision-support techniques to improve sensitivity and specificity of disease detection and monitoring, increasing objectively the clinical decision-making process. This manuscript presents a review in multimodal ocular disease diagnosis and monitoring based on machine learning approaches. In the first section, the technical issues related to the different machine learning approaches will be present. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically recognize complex patterns in a given dataset. These techniques allows creating homogeneous groups (unsupervised learning), or creating a classifier predicting group membership of new cases (supervised learning), when a group label is available for each case. To ensure a good performance of the machine learning techniques in a given dataset, all possible sources of bias should be removed or minimized. For that, the representativeness of the input dataset for the true population should be confirmed, the noise should be removed, the missing data should be treated and the data dimensionally (i.e., the number of parameters/features and the number of cases in the dataset) should be adjusted. The application of machine learning techniques in ocular disease diagnosis and monitoring will be presented and discussed in the second section of this manuscript. To show the clinical benefits of machine learning in clinical vision sciences, several examples will be presented in glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, these ocular pathologies being the major causes of irreversible visual impairment.

AB Depression is a complex clinical entity that can pose challenges for clinicians regarding both accurate diagnosis and effective timely treatment. These challenges have prompted the development of multiple machine learning methods to help improve the management of this disease. These methods utilize anatomical and physiological data acquired from neuroimaging to create models that can identify depressed patients vs. non-depressed patients and predict treatment outcomes.

AB With the continuous development of machine learning, industry and academia have released a lot of machine learning frameworks based on distributed computing platform, and have been widely used. However, the existing framework of machine learning is limited by the limitations of machine learning algorithm itself, such as the choice of parameters and the interference of noises, the high using threshold and so on. This paper introduces the research background of machine learning framework, and combined with the commonly used random forest algorithm in machine learning classification algorithm, puts forward the research objectives and content, proposes an improved adaptive random forest algorithm (referred to as ARF), and on the basis of ARF, designs and implements the machine learning framework.

AB In this position paper, I first describe a new perspective on machine learning (ML) by four basic problems (or levels), namely "What to learn?", "How to learn?", "What to evaluate?", and "What to adjust?". The paper stresses more on the first level of "What to learn?", or "Learning Target Selection". Toward this primary problem within the four levels, I briefly review the existing studies about the connection between information theoretical learning (ITL [1]) and machine learning. A theorem is given on the relation between the empirically-defined similarity measure and information measures. Finally, a conjecture is proposed for pursuing a unified mathematical interpretation to learning target selection.

DE Distributed machine learning; Straggler problem
AB Distributed machine learning is becoming increasingly popular for large scale data mining on large scale cluster. To mitigate the interference of straggler machines, recent distributed machine learning systems support flexible model consistency, which allows worker using a local stale model to compute model update without waiting for the newest model, while limiting the asynchronous step in a certain bound to guarantee the algorithm correctness. However, bounded asynchronous computing can not tolerate consistent straggler. We explore that the root cause of this problem derives from the worker driven parallel training mechanism in existing systems.
   To address the straggler problem fundamentally and fully leverage the asynchronous efficiency, we propose a novel trigger driven parallel training mechanism, where model server proactively triggers to collect updates from workers instead of passively receiving them, which can inherently avoid the coordinating issue among workers. Besides, we devise a dynamic load balancing strategy to make the sampling frequency of each data equal. Furthermore, bounded asynchronous computing is introduced to achieve the algorithm efficiency, as well as the convergence guarantee. Finally, we integrate the above techniques into a distributed machine learning system called Squirrel. Squirrel provides simple programming interface and can easily deploy machine learning algorithms on distributed cluster. In comparison with traditional worker driven parallel training mechanism, trigger driven mechanism can improve up to 4x faster convergence speed of machine learning algorithm.

AB In distributed DNN training, the speed of reading and updating model parameters greatly affects model training time. In this paper we investigate the performance of deep neural network training with parameter sharing based on shared memory for distributed machine learning. We propose a shared memory-based modification of the deep learning framework. In our framework, remote shared memory is used to maintain global shared parameters of parallel deep learning workers. Our framework can accelerate training of DNN by speeding up the parameter sharing in every training iteration in distributed model training. We evaluated our proposed framework by training the three different deep learning model. The experiment results show that our framework improves training time for deep learning models in distributed system.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has shown its good generalization performance and extremely fast learning speed in many learning applications. Recently, it has been proved that ELM outperforms Support Vector Machine (SVM) with less constraints from the optimization point of view. ELM provides unified learning schemes with a widespread type of feature mappings. Among these unified algorithms, ELM with kernels applies kernels instead of random feature mappings. However, with the exponentially increasing volume of training data in massive learning applications, centralized ELM with kernels suffers from the great memory consumption of large matrix operations. Besides, due to the high communication cost, some of these matrix operations cannot be directly implemented on shared-nothing distributed computing model like MapReduce. This paper proposes a distributed solution named Distributed Kernelized ELM (DK-ELM), which realizes an implementation of ELM with kernels on MapReduce. Distributed kernel matrix calculation and multiplication of matrix with vector are also applied to realize parallel calculation of DK-ELM. Extensive experiments on massive datasets are conducted to verify both the scalability and training performance of DK-ELM. Experimental results show that DK-ELM has good scalability for massive learning applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Big data is spreading its span in almost every walk of science and engineering. Both public and private sector enterprises have been collecting and deploying enormous amount of domain-specific information to gain insights about areas like security, marketing, forecasting, fraud-detection, strategic planning etc.. This big data potential is unquestionably noteworthy; but to explore it fully and sensibly it requires new ideas and original learning techniques to address challenges associated with it. With the universe being getting more knowledge-based and computerized, an enormous range of applications shows interest in machine learning (ML) techniques. Machine learning is one of the most sought after field to handle big data challenge. With this paper we endow with a literature analysis related to the up-to-the-minute progress in researches on big data processing deploying Machine Learning as an analytical tool. We will review machine learning techniques with a focus on the promising learning methods like transfer learning, active learning, deep learning, representation learning, distributed, kernel-based learning and parallel learning. Also we will be reviewing the challenges in big data machine learning.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) randomly generates parameters of hidden nodes and then analytically determines the output weights with fast learning speed. The ill-posed problem of parameter matrix of hidden nodes directly causes unstable performance, and the automatical selection problem of the hidden nodes is critical to holding the high efficiency of ELM. Focusing on the ill-posed problem and the automatical selection problem of the hidden nodes, this paper proposes the variational Bayesian extreme learning machine (VBELM). First, the Bayesian probabilistic model is involved into ELM, where the Bayesian prior distribution can avoid the ill-posed problem of hidden node matrix. Then, the variational approximation inference is employed in the Bayesian model to compute the posterior distribution and the independent variational hyperparameters approximately, which can be used to select the hidden nodes automatically. Theoretical analysis and experimental results elucidate that VBELM has stabler performance with more compact architectures, which presents probabilistic predictions comparison with traditional point predictions, and it also provides the hyperparameter criterion for hidden node selection.

AB Learning is an important talent for understanding the nature and accordingly controlling behavioral characteristics. Behavioral learning theories are one of the popular learning theories which are built on experimental findings. These theories are widely applied in psychotherapy, psychology, neurology as well as in advertisements and robotics. There is an abundant literature associated with understanding learning mechanism, and various models have been proposed for the realization of learning theories. Nevertheless, none of those models are able to satisfactorily simulate the concept of classical conditioning. In this study, popular behavioral learning theories were firstly simplified and the contentious issues with them were clarified by conducting intuitive experiments. The experimental results and information available in the literature were evaluated, and behavioral learning theories were jointly generalized accordingly. The proposed model, to our knowledge, is the first one that possesses not only modeling all features of classical conditioning but also including all features with behavioral theories such as Pavlov, Watson, Guthrie, Thorndike and Skinner. Also, a microcontroller card (Arduino Mega 2560) was used to validate the applicability of the proposed model in robotics. Obtained results showed that this generalized model has a high capacity for modeling human learning. Then, the proposed learning model was further improved to be utilized as a machine learning method that can continuously learn similar to human being. The result obtained from the use of this method, in terms of computational cost and accuracy, showed that the proposed method can be successfully employed in machine learning, especially for time ordered datasets.

AB Circular Extreme learning machine (C-ELM) is the one extended Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). It has the same structure as ELM and Circular Back Propagation (CBP) to make it can mapping both linear and circular decision boundaries. The activation function is the one main point to define the decided boundaries. Many activation functions have been proposed. This paper proposes q-Gaussian activation function based on Tsallis statistics that is the one choice to make flexibility decision boundaries with different Gaussian shapes in the Circular Extreme Learning Machine. It calls q-Gaussian activation function Circular Extreme Learning Machine (QC-ELM) that added and varied parameter q (the entropic index) to improve C-ELM's performance. From experimental results of QC-ELM compared with many other methods tested on UCI datasets shows that the QC-ELM has better results in accuracy than many the compared classical methods.

AB The general classification is a machine learning task that tries to assign the best class to a given unknown input vector based on past observations (training data). Most of developed algorithms are very time consuming for large datasets (Support Vector Machine, Deep Neural Networks, etc.). Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a high quality classification algorithm that gains much popularity in recent years. This paper shows that the speed of learning of this algorithm may be improved by using GPU platform. Experimental results showed that proposed approach is much faster and provides the same accuracy as the original ELM algorithm. The proposed approach runs completely on GPU platform and thus it may be effectively incorporated within other applications.

AB Applications are becoming more complicated and diverse as the network environment grows day by day. So, it is important to classify application traffic accurately. Although there are many ways to classify applications traffic, machine learning based approaches are becoming more efficient in nowadays. This is because machine learning methods are more appropriate than existing methods for accurate and efficient applications traffic classification. Payload signature methods have limitations to deal with various patterns and increasing application traffic complexity. In this paper, we propose a method for extracting flow features and a system for classifying applications traffic based on Machine Learning

AB We propose a recursive singular value decomposition (SVD)-based fuzzy extreme learning machine (RSVD-F-ELM) for the online learning in classification or regression analysis. By adopting the same architecture and operation as fuzzy extreme learning machine (F-ELM), which is originally designed for the batch learning, and replacing the Moore Penrose generalized inverse in F-ELM with a recursive SVD-based least squares estimator for optimizing the output weights recursively, RSVD-F-ELM is applicable for the online learning. Compared with the other online learning approach, namely online sequential fuzzy extreme learning machine (OS-F-ELM), experimental results have revealed that RSVD-F-ELM generates the larger accuracy rates in classification analysis and the smaller mean squared errors in regression analysis. Moreover, the learning stability of RSVD-F-ELM is much better.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) has been widely used in various fields to overcome the problem of low training speed of the conventional neural network. Kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) introduces the kernel method to ELM model, which is applicable in Stat ML. However, if the number of samples in Stat ML is too small, perhaps the unbalanced samples cannot reflect the statistical characteristics of the input data, so that the learning ability of Stat ML will be influenced. At the same time, the mix kernel functions used in KELM are conventional functions. Therefore, the selection of kernel function can still be optimized. Based on the problems above, we introduce the weighted method to KELM to deal with the unbalanced samples. Wavelet kernel functions have been widely used in support vector machine and obtain a good classification performance. Therefore, to realize a combination of wavelet analysis and KELM, we introduce wavelet kernel functions to KELM model, which has a mix kernel function of wavelet kernel and sigmoid kernel, and introduce the weighted method to KELM model to balance the sample distribution, and then we propose the weighted wavelet-mix kernel extreme learning machine. The experimental results show that this method can effectively improve the classification ability with better generalization. At the same time, the wavelet kernel functions perform very well compared with the conventional kernel functions in KELM model.

AB Modern engineering design optimization often uses computer simulations to evaluate candidate designs. For some of these designs the simulation can fail for an unknown reason, which in turn hampers the optimization process. To handle such scenarios more effectively this study proposes the integration of classifiers, borrowed from the domain of machine learning, into the optimization process. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach improves the effectiveness of the optimization search.

We apply the algorithm to common machine learning problems such as the least absolute deviation regression problem, support vector machines, and semi-supervised support vector machines. We derive model-specific data aggregation and disaggregation procedures. We also show optimality, convergence, and the optimality gap of the approximated solution in each iteration. A computational study is provided.

AB In this paper, we describe a compact low-power high-performance hardware implementation of extreme learning machine for machine learning applications. Mismatches in current mirrors are used to perform the vector-matrix multiplication that forms the first stage of this classifier and is the most computationally intensive. Both regression and classification (on UCI data sets) are demonstrated and a design space tradeoff between speed, power, and accuracy is explored. Our results indicate that for a wide set of problems, sigma V-T in the range of 15-25 mV gives optimal results. An input weight matrix rotation method to extend the input dimension and hidden layer size beyond the physical limits imposed by the chip is also described. This allows us to overcome a major limit imposed on most hardware machine learners. The chip is implemented in a 0.35-mu m CMOS process and occupies a die area of around 5 mm x 5 mm. Operating from a 1 V power supply, it achieves an energy efficiency of 0.47 pJ/MAC at a classification rate of 31.6 kHz.

AB This research proposes a method of evacuation evaluation using machine learning techniques. Evacuation evaluation must identify when and where people tend to make abnormal movement in emergency evacuation situations. Conventional method asks plenty of manpower to detect abnormal movement time periods. Our method detects the time periods automatically, using classifier and heuristics about human movement.

AB Booking cancellations have significant impact on demand-management decisions in the hospitality industry. To mitigate the effect of cancellations, hotels implement rigid cancellation policies and overbooking tactics, which in turn can have a negative impact on revenue and on the hotel reputation. To reduce this impact, a machine learning based system prototype was developed. It makes use of the hotel's Property Management Systems data and trains a classification model every day to predict which bookings are "likely to cancel" and with that calculate net demand. This prototype, deployed in a production environment in two hotels, by enforcing A/B testing, also enables the measurement of the impact of actions taken to act upon bookings predicted as "likely to cancel". Results indicate good prototype performance and provide important indications for research progress whilst evidencing that bookings contacted by hotels cancel less than bookings not contacted.

AB The growing scale and complexity of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has resulted in prevalent use of distributed general-purpose systems. In a rather disjoint effort, the community is focusing mostly on high performance single-node accelerators for learning. This work bridges these two paradigms and offers CoSMIC, a full computing stack constituting language, compiler, system software, template architecture, and circuit generators, that enable programmable acceleration of learning at scale. CoSMIC enables programmers to exploit scale-out acceleration using FPGAs and Programmable ASICs (P-ASICs) from a high-level and mathematical Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Nonetheless, CoSMIC does not require programmers to delve into the onerous task of system software development or hardware design. CoSMIC achieves three conflicting objectives of efficiency, automation, and programmability, by integrating a novel multi-threaded template accelerator architecture and a cohesive stack that generates the hardware and software code from its high-level DSL. CoSMIC can accelerate a wide range of learning algorithms that are most commonly trained using parallel variants of gradient descent. The key is to distribute partial gradient calculations of the learning algorithms across the accelerator-augmented nodes of the scale-out system. Additionally, CoSMIC leverages the parallelizability of the algorithms to offer multi-threaded acceleration within each node. Multi-threading allows CoSMIC to efficiently exploit the numerous resources that are becoming available on modern FPGAs/P-ASICs by striking a balance between multi-threaded parallelism and single-threaded performance. CoSMIC takes advantage of algorithmic properties of ML to offer a specialized system software that optimizes task allocation, role-assignment, thread management, and internode communication. We evaluate the versatility and efficiency of CoSMIC for 10 different machine learning applications from various domains. On average, a 16-node CoSMIC with UltraScale+ FPGAs offers 18.8x speedup over a 16-node Spark system with Xeon processors while the programmer only writes 22-55 lines of code. CoSMIC offers higher scalability compared to the state-of-the-art Spark; scaling from 4 to 16 nodes with CoSMIC yields 2.7x improvements whereas Spark offers 1.8x. These results confirm that the full-stack approach of CoSMIC takes an effective and vital step towards enabling scale-out acceleration for machine learning.

AB The problem of choosing error penalty parameter C for optimization extreme learning machine (OELM) is that it can take any positive value for different applications and it is therefore hard to choose correctly. In this paper, we reformulated OELM to take a new regularization parameter nu (nu-OELM) which is inspired by Scholkopf et al. The regularization in terms of nu is bounded between 0 and 1, and is easier to interpret as compared to C. This paper shows that: (1) nu-OELM and nu-SVM have similar dual optimization formulation, but nu-OELM has less optimization constraints due to its special capability of class separation and (2) experiment results on both artificial and real binary classification problems show that nu-OELM tends to achieve better generalization performance than nu-SVM, OELM and other popular machine learning approaches, and it is computationally efficient on high dimension data sets. Additionally, the optimal parameter nu in nu-OELM can be easily selected from few candidates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE machine learning; performance/security trade-off
AB In Biometric Authentication Systems (BAS), the variability amongst population biometric data ensures distinctiveness, and helps minimizing false acceptance of non-subject data. However, higher variability implies temporal variations for a given subject, which can potentially reject subject data. Such variations are suppressed using feature extraction and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for improving the performance, but also reduce the adversary's effort in breaking the system (security strength) using forged data. Typically for BAS design, performance and security strength are evaluated in isolation using experimental analysis. This research provides an analytical approach to evaluate the BAS performance and strength, and their trade-off, by modeling the biometric data, and studying the effect of feature extraction and ML configurations on processing the data. Experimental analysis on 106 subjects' brain signal validates the analytical methodology results.

For each QCELM is work on the CELM using q-Gaussian activation functions based on Tsallis distribution that varies the different parameter q values (called the entropic index) and selects the best parameter q to take the highest accuracy; As a result, QCELM is more accurate than traditional and applied ELMs. In the experiment, the results of the simulation on 46 datasets from UCI repository shows that Majority Voting based on q-Gaussian Circular Extreme Learning Machine (V-QCELM) outperforms several Extreme Learning Machine ensembles. Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to confirm statistical differences between V-QCELM and the compared ELM ensembles that can indicate V-QCELM is the higher-performance ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines.

AB The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth of data streams in Internet, biometrics, remote sensing and other fields. Nowadays many supervised incremental/online learning approaches have been developed, to avoid retraining and reduce the computational complexity when data come chunk by chunk. However, these methods cant obtain satisfied performance when the labeled samples are limited. In this paper, we propose an Incremental Laplacian Regularization Extreme Learning Machine (ILR-ELM) for semi-supervised online learning, by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled samples. Unlike most of the existing semi-supervised incremental/online learning algorithms, this paper not only proposes incremental/online learning mechanism for data chunk containing both labeled and unlabeled samples but also proposes incremental/online learning mechanism for data chunk containing only unlabeled samples. The latter case is more common in practical applications because there is usually no enough time to label the samples for continuously arriving data stream. The alternative analytical solutions of ILR-ELM for the two incremental/online learning mechanisms are also presented. The performance of ILR-ELM is evaluated on three benchmark machine learning data, and the results show that it can achieve near accurate and robust classification/regression with a small number of labeled data, and outperforms the incremental/online learning approaches. Compared with the supervised and the comparative semi-supervised incremental/online learning methods, the generalization accuracy of ILR-ELM is increased by nearly 9% and 2% respectively for the classification problem. For the regression problem, the generalization error of ILR-ELM is reduced by nearly 14% than the supervised incremental/online learning methods and 1% than compared semi-supervised incremental/online learning methods Furthermore, ILR-ELM can achieve comparable prediction to semi-supervised batch learning, using less time and Random Access Memory (RAM).

AB Data mining and information extraction from data is a field that has gained relevance in recent years thanks to techniques based on artificial intelligence and use of machine and deep learning. The main aim of the present work is the development of a tool based on a previous behaviour study of security audit tools (oriented to SQL pentesting) with the purpose of creating testing sets capable of performing an accurate detection of a SQL attack. The study is based on the information collected through the generated web server logs in a pentesting laboratory environment. Then, making use of the common extracted patterns from the logs, each attack vector has been classified in risk levels (dangerous attack, normal attack, non-attack, etc.). Finally, a training with the generated data was performed in order to obtain a classifier system that has a variable performance between 97 and 99 percent in positive attack detection. The training data is shared to other servers in order to create a distributed network capable of deciding if a query is an attack or is a real petition and inform to connected clients in order to block the petitions from the attacker's IP.

AB The majority of this paper dealing with unrelated parallel machines scheduling problems with a truncated job-dependent learning effect, in which the actual processing time of a job is a function which depends not only on the jobdependent learning effect but also on a control parameter. The goal is to determine the jobs assigned to corresponding each machine and the corresponding optimal schedule to minimize the total machine load and the total completion time respectively. If the number of machines is a given constant, we propose efficient polynomial time algorithms respectively.

AB In this work, we are attempting to grade short answer automatically which can be efficient and helpful to both students and teachers. It uses a combination of many semantic and graph alignment features and is implemented in the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning using Two-class Averaged Perceptron, Linear and Isotonic Regression. We also provide first attempt to use graph alignment features at sentence level. We compare the results of two machine learning algorithms like Two-class Averaged Perceptron and Two class Support Vector Machine in the results of grading short answers. We have devised novel techniques to apply the concept of Random Projection for grading 150 algorithmic answers on a coding question using our own domain specific corpus which gives precise classification of right and wrong answers.

AB This paper describes induction motors learning as an important component of electric engineering education. Based on a few years experience this study introduces a new concept of learning in the training field. This concept is implemented by One2One Project. Because teaching in this field relies on electricity and magnetism, energy conversion, AC circuit, measurement method and concepts as well as applied power engineering, students in graduate educational programs find the topics cross-disciplinary, practical, and motivational.
   The intention of One2one project is double: on one hand, to bring closer the needs of the companies to schools and, on the other hand, to improve the pedagogical methodology. This type of project is allowing teachers to pay attention to each singular student, and concerning about their own personal learning rhythms. In the present project, the student is going to know the component's parts of the induction machines and operating principals. Based on this, the student is going to identify an induction machine from the details on the machine rating label the terminal board, connect the motor according to a circuit diagram and operate the motor for recording the nominal performance values, calculate specified variables, using given formulae and measured values and draw the load characteristic curves from the obtained values. The student will indicate the value of nominal torque on the characteristic curves and comment the shape of the characteristic curves.

AB Currently, state-of-the-art motor intention decoding algorithms in brain-machine interfaces are mostly implemented on a PC and consume significant amount of power. A machine learning coprocessor in 0.35-mu m CMOS for the motor intention decoding in the brain-machine interfaces is presented in this paper. Using Extreme Learning Machine algorithm and low-power analog processing, it achieves an energy efficiency of 3.45 pJ/MAC at a classification rate of 50 Hz. The learning in second stage and corresponding digitally stored coefficients are used to increase robustness of the core analog processor. The chip is verified with neural data recorded in monkey finger movements experiment, achieving a decoding accuracy of 99.3% for movement type. The same coprocessor is also used to decode time of movement from asynchronous neural spikes. With time-delayed feature dimension enhancement, the classification accuracy can be increased by 5% with limited number of input channels. Further, a sparsity promoting training scheme enables reduction of number of programmable weights by approximate to 2X.

AB Credit evaluation models are the important tools used by banks for the evaluation of loan customers as good or bad. These models are developed as a part of data mining projects using mainly the Classification and Clustering tasks. Their accuracy plays a very significant role as they are the backbones behind the important decisions taken by banks. The accuracy can be improved by using many factors, some of these are the use of good machine learning techniques, balanced input data, and using hybrid techniques in model development. The machine learning and statistical techniques can be combined in various ways for creating the effective hybrid models. In this paper the input data has been balanced to avoid biased model training towards the larger class. Machine learning techniques which have been proved successful in many experiments on financial data are used for this study. The machine learning techniques used are: NaIve Bayes, MLP, RBF, Logistic Regression and C4.5. First single models have been developed using these machine learning techniques and the one with highest accuracy has been found. Then this model was hybridized with others for improving the classification accuracy. The accuracy of all these models was tested on a separate test set that has not been shown to the model while training. A bench marked credit dataset has been utilized for conducting the experiments. The results of the single and hybrid models shows that the MLP outperformed all other individual models while the hybrid model developed by combining the MLP with MLP gave the best results.

AB Learning incorporates a broad range of complex procedures. Machine learning (ML) is a subdivision of artificial intelligence based on the biological learning process. The ML approach deals with the design of algorithms to learn from machine readable data. ML covers main domains such as data mining, difficult to-program applications, and software applications. It is a collection of a variety of algorithms (e.g. neural networks, support vector machines, self-organizing map, decision trees, random forests, case-based reasoning, genetic programming, etc.) that can provide multivariate, nonlinear, nonparametric regression or classification. The modeling capabilities of the ML-based methods have resulted in their extensive applications in science and engineering. Herein, the role of ML as an effective approach for solving problems in geosciences and remote sensing will be highlighted. The unique features of some of the ML techniques will be outlined with a specific attention to genetic programming paradigm. Furthermore, nonparametric regression and classification illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of ML for tackling the geosciences and remote sensing problems.

DE Cloud computing; Machine learning
AB Decision making in cloud environments is quite challenging due to the diversity in service offerings and pricing models, especially considering that the cloud market is an incredibly fast moving one. In addition, there are no hard and fast rules; each customer has a specific set of constraints (e.g. budget) and application requirements (e.g. minimum computational resources). Machine learning can help address some of the complicated decisions by carrying out customer-specific analytics to determine the most suitable instance type(s) and the most opportune time for starting or migrating instances. We employ machine learning techniques to develop an adaptive deployment policy, providing an optimal match between the customer demands and the available cloud service offerings. We provide an experimental study based on extensive set of job executions over a major public cloud infrastructure.

AB Object: Our purpose was to develop a new machine-learning approach (a virtual health check-up) toward identification of those at high risk of hyperuricemia. Applying the system to general health check-ups is expected to reduce medical costs compared with administering an additional test.
   Methods: Data were collected during annual health check-ups performed in Japan between 2011 and 2013 (inclusive). We prepared training and test datasets from the health check-up data to build prediction models; these were composed of 43,524 and 17,789 persons, respectively. Gradient-boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) approaches were trained using the training dataset and were then used to predict hyperuricemia in the test dataset. Undersampling was applied to build the prediction models to deal with the imbalanced class dataset.
   Results: The results showed that the RF and GBDT approaches afforded the best performances in terms of sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the models, which reflected the total discriminative ability of the classification, were 0.796 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.766-0.825] for the GBDT, 0.784 [95% CI: 0.752-0.815] for the RF, and 0.785 [95% CI: 0.752-0.819] for the LR approaches. No significant differences were observed between pairs of each approach. Small changes occurred in the AUCs after applying undersampling to build the models.
   Conclusions: We developed a virtual health check-up that predicted the development of hyperuricemia using machine-learning methods. The GBDT, RF, and LR methods had similar predictive capability. Undersampling did not remarkably improve predictive power. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An asperity's location is very crucial in the spatiotemporal analysis of an area's seismicity. In literature, b-value and seismic density have been proven as useful indicators for asperity location. In this paper, machine learning techniques are used to locate areas with high probability of asperity existence using as feature vector information extracted solely by earthquake catalogs. Many machine learning algorithms are tested to identify those with the best results. This method is tested for data from the wider region of Hokkaido, Japan where in an earlier study asperities have been detected.

AB As considered in this study, machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence which provides computation algorithms without explicit programming. The calculation rules are learned from a set of data that associates the inputs to the outputs. Machine learning based estimator is developed to predict the rotor position of an electrical machine. The estimator requires only the phase currents to be measured. An off-line training makes the model learn to associate rotor position to each instantaneous current measurement. The estimation precision depends on the quality of current measurements and on the effectiveness of the training. Compared to rotor position acquired using mechanical sensor, the estimation error doesn't exceed few percents which is enough to implement a sensorless control or to make safe redundancy of the mechanical sensor. The estimator is developed for a permanent magnets synchronous machine used on the power train of an electric vehicle. Potentially, machine learning based estimator can cover all the speed/torque range of the machine.

AB Iris recognition is one of the most promising fields in biometrics. Notwithstanding this, there are not so many research works addressing it by machine learning techniques. In this survey, we especially focus on recognition, and leave the detection and feature extraction problems in the background. However, the kind of features used to code the iris pattern may significantly influence the complexity of the methods and their performance. In other words, complexity affects learning, and iris patterns require relatively complex feature vectors, even if their size can be optimized. A cross-comparison of these two parameters, feature complexity vs. learning effectiveness, in the context of different learning algorithms, would require an unbiased common benchmark. Moreover, at present it is still very difficult to reproduce techniques and experiments due to the lack of either sufficient implementation details or reliable shared code. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) has gained increasing interest from various research fields recently. In this review, we aim to report the current state of the theoretical research and practical advances on this subject. We first give an overview of ELM from the theoretical perspective, including the interpolation theory, universal approximation capability, and generalization ability. Then we focus on the various improvements made to ELM which further improve its stability, sparsity and accuracy under general or specific conditions. Apart from classification and regression, ELM has recently been extended for clustering, feature selection, representational learning and many other learning tasks. These newly emerging algorithms greatly expand the applications of ELM. From implementation aspect, hardware implementation and parallel computation techniques have substantially sped up the training of ELM, making it feasible for big data processing and real-time reasoning. Due to its remarkable efficiency, simplicity, and impressive generalization performance, ELM have been applied in a variety of domains, such as biomedical engineering, computer vision, system identification, and control and robotics. In this review, we try to provide a comprehensive view of these advances in ELM together with its future perspectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fact that the linear estimators using the rank-based Wilcoxon approach in linear regression problems are usually insensitive to outliers is known in statistics. Outliers are the data points that differ greatly from the pattern set by the bulk of the data. Inspired by this fact, Hsieh et al. introduced the Wilcoxon approach into the area of machine learning. They investigated four new learning machines, such as Wilcoxon neural network (WNN), and developed four gradient descent based backpropagation algorithms to train these learning machines. The performances of these machines are better than ordinary nonrobust neural networks in outliers exist tasks. However, it is hard to balance the learning speed and the stability of these algorithms which is inherently the drawback of gradient descent based algorithms. In this paper, a new algorithm is used to train the output weights of single-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) with input weights and biases being randomly chosen. This algorithm is called Wilcoxon-norm based robust extreme learning machine or WRELM for short. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Traditional global optimization algorithms is generally explored in whole deep belief network (DBN) with consuming amount of time, while the optimal method based on gradient used in DBN tends to local optimization. For solving this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel method which use extreme learning machine (ELM) into the training procedure of DBN to accelerate the learning process of DBN. Extensive experiment on the three widely available datasets demonstrate that our proposal effectively improves the accuracy and efficiency of the learning process of DBN, the result shows that our approach has a higher learning speed with a reliable learning accuracy.

AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) framework provides an efficient way for constructing single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs). Its main idea is that the input bias terms and the input weights of the hidden nodes are selected in a random way. During training, we only need to adjust the output weights of the hidden nodes. The existing incremental learning algorithms, called incremental-ELM (I-ELM) and convex I-ELM (CI-ELM), for extreme learning machines (ELMs) cannot handle the fault situation. This paper proposes two fault-tolerant incremental ELM algorithms, namely fault-tolerant I-ELM (FTI-ELM) and fault-tolerant CI-ELM (FTCI-ELM). The FTI-ELM only tunes the output weight of the newly additive node to minimize the training set error of faulty networks. It keeps all the previous learned weights unchanged. Its fault-tolerant performance is better than that of I-ELM and CI-ELM. To further improve the performance, the FTCI-ELM is proposed. It tunes the output weight of the newly additive node, as well as using a simple scheme to modify the existing output weights, to maximize the reduction in the training set error of faulty networks.

AB A novel approach to extreme learning machine (ELM) ensembles is proposed. It incorporates majority voting into the recently proposed q-generalized random neural network (QRNN) to make the final decision for classification problems. Individual ELMs are trained with q-Gaussian activation functions using different values of the parameter q (called the entropic index). As a result, these classifiers are generally more accurate than traditional ELMs. Simulations on 45 machine learning data sets show that this method, termed voting based q-generalized extreme learning machine (V-QELM), outperforms other extreme learning machine ensembles. Statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Friedman, and Nemenyi) are used to validate statistical differences between our results. Kappa-error diagrams reveal that V-QELM constructs more accurate classifiers than those found in other ensemble methods. This implies that incorporating QRNNs can lead to higher performing ensembles of extreme learning machines. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning is a sub field of artificial intelligence which allows forecasting through learning past behaviors and rules from old data. In today's world, machine learning is being used almost in any fields such as education, medicine, veterinary, banking, telecommunication, security, and bio-medical sciences. In human health, although machine learning is generally preferred particularly in predicting diseases and identifying respective risk factors, it is obvious that there are a limited number of publications where this method was applied on veterinary or indicates whether it is correct and applicable. In this review, it was observed that the neural network, logistic regression, linear regression, multiple regression, principle component analysis and k-means methods were frequently used in examined publications and machine learning application in veterinary field upward momentum. Additionally, it was observed that recent developments in the field of machine learning (deep learning, ensemble learning, voice recognition, emotion recognition, etc.) is still new in the field of veterinary. In this review, publications are examined under clustering, classification, regression, multivariate data analysis and image processing topics. This review aims at providing basic information on machine learning and to increase the number of multidisciplinary publications on computer sciences/engineering and veterinary field.

AB As one of supervised learning algorithms, extreme learning machine (ELM) has been proposed for training single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks and shown great generalization performance. ELM randomly assigns the weights and biases between input and hidden layers and only learns the weights between hidden and output layers. Physiological research has shown that neurons at the same layer are laterally inhibited to each other such that outputs of each layer are sparse. However, it is difficult for ELM to accommodate the lateral inhibition by directly using random feature mapping. Therefore, this paper proposes a sparse coding ELM (ScELM) algorithm, which can map the input feature vector into a sparse representation. In this proposed ScELM algorithm, an unsupervised way is used for sparse coding and dictionary is randomly assigned rather than learned. Gradient projection based method is used for the sparse coding. The output weights are trained through the same supervised way as ELM. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets have shown that this proposed ScELM algorithm can outperform other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nowadays, large amount of data is available everywhere. Therefore, it is very important to analyze this data in order to extract some useful information and to develop an algorithm based on this analysis. This can be achieved through data mining and machine learning. Machine learning is an integral part of artificial intelligence, which is used to design algorithms based on the data trends and historical relationships between data. Machine learning is used in various fields such as bioinformatics, intrusion detection, Information retrieval, game playing, marketing, malware detection, image deconvolution and so on.

DE Outlier detection; Cluster-based; Unsupervised extreme learning machines
AB Outlier detection is an important data mining task, whose target is to find the abnormal or atypical objects from a given data set. The techniques for detecting outliers have a lot of applications, such as credit card fraud detection, environment monitoring, etc. In this paper, we proposed a new definition of outlier, called cluster-based outlier. Comparing with the existing definitions, the cluster-based outlier is more suitable for the complicated data sets that consist of many clusters with different densities. To detect cluster-based outliers, we first split the given data set into a number of clusters using unsupervised extreme learning machines. Then, we further design a pruning method technique to efficiently compute outliers in each cluster. at last, the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches are verified through plenty of simulation experiments.

AB In this paper, a social network model is built for the social network information in the social network, and the machine learning method is used to calculate the node trust value. First, the results calculated by the traditional node trust value calculation method and some auxiliary information are used as the training feature of the machine learning, and the measurement whether there is edge between nodes as label information. Second, the node logistic regression model is used as the training model to calculate the node trust value. Then, recommendation algorithm which is analogous to the user collaborative filtering algorithm is used to calculate node trust value. At last, the simulation is used to verify the performance of the improved method, and the results show that the prediction accuracy of node trust value computing by improved algorithm is significantly higher than that of node trust value computing by formula.

AB Extreme learning machine, as a generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward network, has achieved much attention for its extremely fast learning speed and good generalization performance. However, big data often makes a challenge in large scale learning of extreme learning machine due to the memory limitation of single machine as well as the distributed manner of large scale data in many applications. For the purpose of relieving the limitation of memory with big data, in this paper, we exploit a novel distributed model to implement the extreme learning machine algorithm in parallel for large-scale data set, namely distributed extreme learning machine (DELM). A corresponding algorithm is developed on the basis of alternating direction method of multipliers which has shown its effectiveness in distributed convex optimization. Finally, extensive experiments on some benchmark data sets are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DELM method with an analysis on the performance of speedup, scaleup and sizeup.

AB All people can not do as they plan, it happens because of their habits. Therefore, habits and moods may affect their productivity. Hence, the habits and moods are the important parts of person's life. Such habits may be analyzed with various machine learning techniques as available nowadays. Now the question of analyzing the Habits and moods of a person with a goal of increasing one's productivity comes to mind. This paper discusses one such technique called HDML (Habit Detection with Machine Learning). HDML model analyses the mood which helps us to deal with a bad mood or a state of unproductivity, through suggestions about such activities that alleviate our mood. The overall accuracy of the model is about 87.5 %.

ID PHILOSOPHY
AB With the growing success of machine learning, both researchers and philosophers have recently regained their interest in the foundational problems of statistical learning. The cooperation between philosophy and machine learning has been recognized to be mutually beneficial that may provide fundamental shift in the paradigms of both camps. In this paper, a unidirectional interaction between philosophy and machine learning is considered. This type of interaction becomes necessary as we reflect upon the practical implications of the model construction. To this extent, I review a specific set of contributions of philosophy to machine learning in determining epistemic standing of object representation and algorithmic design. I discuss three aspects of statistical models, pertaining to semantics of object representation, namely idealization (simplifying properties of an object), abstraction (representing an object with another object that is easier to handle), and use of latent variables. I argue to what extent these aspects necessitate philosophical attention to justify their practical use. To this end, I elucidate different philosophical concepts that are utilized by researchers mostly tacitly when dealing with uncertainties in features and their functional relationships. This is expected to help pave the way for further investigations on semantics of object representation in machine learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The digital image processing is a fast pace growing field which requires pre-processing of the images before their actual usage and experimentation. Image Segmentation and Object Recognition is one of the phase which requires the prior information about the object to give the extracted attributes as output of the images. Here, in the present research work we have already some outdoor segmented images which have been identified as to which category of classification they belong. This work has been accelerated with the help of machine learning that is a novel technique to identify the objects with outstanding accuracy. The machine learning algorithms have aided in this process of identifying the objects like sky, brick, cement, grass etc. This collaboration of image segmentation with machine learning has proved to be accessible in large datasets where after segmentation images can classify themselves into a category provided it has attributes of the images.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Machine learning is rapidly emerging as a valuable technology thanks to its ability to learn patterns from large data sets and solve problems that are impossible to model using conventional programming logic. As machine learning techniques become more mainstream, they are being applied to a wider range of application domains. These algorithms are now trusted to make critical decisions in secure and adversarial environments such as healthcare, fraud detection, and network security, in which mistakes can be incredibly costly. They are also a critical component to most modern autonomous systems. However, the data driven approach utilized by these machine learning methods can prove to be a weakness if the data on which the models rely are corrupted by either nefarious or accidental means. Models that utilize on-line learning or periodic retraining to learn new patterns and account for data distribution changes are particularly susceptible to corruption through model drift. In modeling this type of scenario, specially crafted data points are added to the training set over time to adversely influence the system, inducing model drift which leads to incorrect classifications. Our work is focused on exploring the resistance of various machine learning algorithms to such an approach. In this paper we present an experimental framework designed to measure the susceptibility of anomaly detection algorithms to model drift. We also exhibit our preliminary results using various machine learning algorithms commonly found in intrusion detection research.

AB With the rapid development of economy in these years, the condition has become more and more severe that human being have polluted environment. In order to implement and reduce pollutant emissions for a power plant, an accurate model is required. This study proposed an improved Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) called Bidirectional learning machine (BLM) to establish precise and rapid models of pollutant emissions involving NOx emissions and Dust content in flue gas for a 300MW Circulating fluidized bed boiler (CFBB). Experimental results show, compared with two recently published state-of-the-art algorithms Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Least Square Fast Learning Network (LSFLN), BLM with less running time could achieve better generalization performance and more highly repeatability and reproducibility for predicting pollutant emissions.

AB Objectives: Pure-tone audiometry has been a staple of hearing assessments for decades. Many different procedures have been proposed for measuring thresholds with pure tones by systematically manipulating intensity one frequency at a time until a discrete threshold function is determined. The authors have developed a novel nonparametric approach for estimating a continuous threshold audiogram using Bayesian estimation and machine learning classification. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of this new method relative to a commonly used threshold measurement technique.
   Design: The authors performed air conduction pure-tone audiometry on 21 participants between the ages of 18 and 90 years with varying degrees of hearing ability. Two repetitions of automated machine learning audiogram estimation and one repetition of conventional modified Hughson-Westlake ascending-descending audiogram estimation were acquired by an audiologist. The estimated hearing thresholds of these two techniques were compared at standard audiogram frequencies (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 kHz).
   Results: The two threshold estimate methods delivered very similar estimates at standard audiogram frequencies. Specifically, the mean absolute difference between estimates was 4.16 3.76 dB HL. The mean absolute difference between repeated measurements of the new machine learning procedure was 4.51 +/- 4.45 dB HL. These values compare favorably with those of other threshold audiogram estimation procedures. Furthermore, the machine learning method generated threshold estimates from significantly fewer samples than the modified Hughson-Westlake procedure while returning a continuous threshold estimate as a function of frequency.
   Conclusions: The new machine learning audiogram estimation technique produces continuous threshold audiogram estimates accurately, reliably, and efficiently, making it a strong candidate for widespread application in clinical and research audiometry.

AB We propose a machine-learning approach for design of planar inverted-F antennas with a magneto-dielectric nanocomposite substrate. It is shown that machine-learning techniques can be efficiently used to characterize nanomagnetic-based antennas by accurately mapping the particle radius and volume fraction of the nanomagnetic material to antenna parameters such as gain, bandwidth, radiation efficiency, and resonant frequency. A modified mixing rule model is also presented. In addition, the inverse problem is addressed through machine learning as well, where given the antenna parameters, the corresponding design space of possible material parameters is identified.

AB Machine learning techniques are being increasingly used for detection and diagnosis of diseases for its accuracy and efficiency in pattern classification. In this paper, improved cuckoo search based extreme learning machine (ICSELM) is proposed to classify binary medical datasets. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is widely used as a learning algorithm for training single layer feed forward neural networks (SLFN) in the field of classification. However, to make the model more stable, an evolutionary algorithm improved cuckoo search (ICS) is used to pre-train ELM by selecting the input weights and hidden biases. Like ELM, Moore-Penrose (MP) generalized inverse is used in ICSELM to analytically determines the output weights. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, four benchmark datasets, i.e. Breast Cancer, Diabetes, Bupa and Hepatitis from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning are used. A number of useful performance evaluation measures including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, Gmean, F-score and norm of the output weights as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve are computed. The results are analyzed and compared with both ELM based models like ELM, on-line sequential extreme learning algorithm (OSELM), CSELM and other artificial neural networks i.e. multi-layered perceptron (MLP), MLPCS, MLPICS and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), RBFNNCS, RBFNNICS. The experimental results demonstrate that the ICSELM model outperforms other models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main originality of our framework is that only a very simple image acquisition device, as a computer camera, is sufficient to establish a rich human machine interaction as traditional devices such as mouse or keyboard. This framework is based on well known computer vision techniques and efficient machine learning techniques are used to detect and track user hand gestures so the end user can control his computer using virtual interfaces with very simple gestures.

AB To assure cyber security of an enterprise, typically SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system is in place to normalize security events from different preventive technologies and flag alerts. Analysts in the security operation center (SOC) investigate the alerts to decide if it is truly malicious or not. However, generally the number of alerts is overwhelming with majority of them being false positive and exceeding the SOC's capacity to handle all alerts. Because of this, potential malicious attacks and compromised hosts may be missed. Machine learning is a viable approach to reduce the false positive rate and improve the productivity of SOC analysts. In this paper, we develop a user-centric machine learning framework for the cyber security operation center in real enterprise environment. We discuss the typical data sources in SOC, their work flow, and how to leverage and process these data sets to build an effective machine learning system. The paper is targeted towards two groups of readers. The first group is data scientists or machine learning researchers who do not have cyber security domain knowledge but want to build machine learning systems for security operations center. The second group of audiences are those cyber security practitioners who have deep knowledge and expertise in cyber security, but do not have machine learning experiences and wish to build one by themselves. Throughout the paper, we use the system we built in the Symantec SOC production environment as an example to demonstrate the complete steps from data collection, label creation, feature engineering, machine learning algorithm selection, model performance evaluations, to risk score generation.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) was extended from the generalized single hidden layer feedforward networks where the input weights of the hidden layer nodes can be assigned randomly. It has been widely used for its much faster learning speed and less manual works. Considering the field of multi-label text classification, in this paper, we propose an ELM based algorithm combined with L-21-norm minimization of the output weights matrix called L-21-norm Minimization ELM, which not only fully inherits the merits of ELM but also facilitates group sparsity and reduces complexity of the learning model. Extensive experiments on several bench-mark data sets show a more desirable performance compared with other common multi-label classification algorithms.

ID RECOGNITION
AB While machine learning is a powerful tool for the analysis and classification of complex real-world datasets, it is still challenging, particularly for developers with limited expertise, to incorporate this technology into their software systems. The first step in machine learning, data labeling, is traditionally thought of as a tedious, unavoidable task in building a machine learning classifier. However, in this paper, we argue that it can also serve as the first opportunity for developers to gain insight into their dataset. Through a Label-and-Learn interface, we explore visualization strategies that leverage the data labeling task to enhance developers' knowledge about their dataset, including the likely success of the classifier and the rationale behind the classifier's decisions. At the same time, we show that the visualizations also improve users' labeling experience by showing them the impact they have made on classifier performance. We assess the visualizations in Label-and-Learn and experimentally demonstrate their value to software developers who seek to assess the utility of machine learning during the data labeling process.

According to their strategies, sub-classifiers of the lower level make decisions about the presence of paraphrase in sentences, while a super-classifier of the upper level makes the final decision. Conducted experiments demonstrated that the system has the accuracy of the paraphrase detection comparable with the best known analogous systems while being superior to all of them in implementation.

AB Now a day's data is growing very rapidly, where processing and analyzing data to get useful information is the main task. There are many big data processing tools and framework such as Hadoop, Hive, Cassandra etc. Spark is one of the fastest big data processing framework in cluster computation.
   Basic Idea is to analyze the performance of java virtual machine (JVM) [1], by characterizing java virtual machine using SparkBench benchmark on Apache Spark (TM) [2]. Java virtual machine is a core execution platform for spark application. When we run the spark application on java virtual machine, its behavior is affected, which needs to be monitored to analyze the JVM performance. Here we are considering Machine Learning workloads like K-Means, Matrix Factorization and Logistic Regression. Main goal here is to analyze the machine learning workloads end to end across the cluster, with respect to following parameters such as garbage collection, memory such as heap usage, CPU process time. Characterization of JVM is done with spark cluster setup and HDFS is used as storage with distributed Hadoop cluster setup.

AB In this study, we apply machine learning algorithms to predict technical failures that can be encountered in Oracle databases and related services. In order to train machine learning algorithms, data from log files are collected hourly from Oracle database systems and labeled with two classes; normal or abnormal. We use several data science approaches to preprocess and transform the input data from raw format to the format, which can be feed to the algorithms. After the preprocessing, several different machine learning classifiers are trained and evaluated on our datasets. Our results show that warnings that lead to failures which is dubbed as abnormal events can be predicted using supervised machine learning algorithms, in particular, the Random Forest algorithm, with a relatively satisfactory Recall (75.7%) and Precision (84.9%) which is visibly higher than the other classifiers.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an efficient learning algorithm of training single layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs). With the development of unsupervised learning in recent years, integrating ELM with autoencoder has become a new perspective for extracting feature using unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a new variant of extreme learning machine autoencoder (ELM-AE) called generalized extreme learning machine autoencoder (GELM-AE) which adds the manifold regularization to the objective of ELM-AE. Some experiments carried out on real-world data sets show that GELM-AE outperforms some state-of-the-art unsupervised learning algorithms, including k-means, laplacian embedding (LE), spectral clustering (SC) and ELM-AE. Furthermore, we also propose a new deep neural network called multilayer generalized extreme learning machine autoencoder (ML-GELM) by stacking several GELM-AE to detect more abstract representations. The experiments results show that ML-GELM outperforms ELM and many other deep models, such as multilayer ELM autoencoder (ML-ELM), deep belief network (DBN) and stacked autoencoder (SAE). Due to the utilization of ELM, ML-GELM is also faster than DBN and SAE.

   Regression
AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a popular machine learning algorithm due to its fast non-iterative training and good generalization [2]. However, it randomly assigns input weights and biases from a uniform distribution regardless of the characteristics of the training data. Exploiting this data would produce a more specialized model, instead of adopting a "one size fits all" approach. This could result in better generalization while preserving ELM's fast training.
   Hence, we developed a context dependent input weight selection for regression ELM (CDR-ELM) which is a non-iterative training algorithm for supervised regression. First, k-means clusters input data into P clusters based on the number of hidden layer neurons. Then, cluster head differences are assigned to input weights as described in (1), and biases are computed from cluster sizes as b(i) = N-j/N-k. Finally, ELM is trained using least squares.

AB Conventional extreme learning machines (ELMs) solve a Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of hidden layer activated matrix and analytically determine the output weights to achieve generalized performance, by assuming the same loss from different types of misclassification. The assumption may not hold in cost-sensitive recognition tasks, such as face recognitionbased access control system, where misclassifying a stranger as a family member may result in more serious disaster than misclassifying a family member as a stranger. Though recent cost-sensitive learning can reduce the total loss with a given cost matrix that quantifies how severe one type of mistake against another, in many realistic cases, the cost matrix is unknown to users. Motivated by these concerns, this paper proposes an evolutionary cost-sensitive ELM, with the following merits: 1) to the best of our knowledge, it is the first proposal of ELM in evolutionary cost-sensitive classification scenario; 2) it well addresses the open issue of how to define the cost matrix in cost-sensitive learning tasks; and 3) an evolutionary backtracking search algorithm is induced for adaptive cost matrix optimization. Experiments in a variety of cost-sensitive tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, with about 5%-10% improvements.

AB Previous research has indicated that physiological signals can be used to detect mental stress. There is however no consensus on the optimal algorithm for this detection. The aim of this study is to compare different machine learning techniques for the measurement of stress based on physiological responses in a controlled environment. Electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), temperature and respiration were measured during a laboratory stress test. Six machine learning techniques were investigated using a general and personal approach. The results show that personalized dynamic Bayesian networks and generalized support vector machines render the best average classification results with 84.6 % and 82.7 % respectively.

AB In order to overcome the disadvantage of the traditional algorithm for SLFN (single-hidden layer feedforward neural network), an improved algorithm for SLFN, called extreme learning machine (ELM), is proposed by Huang et al. However, ELMis sensitive to the neuron number in hidden layer and its selection is a difficult-to-solve problem. In this paper, a self-adaptive mechanism is introduced into the ELM. Herein, a new variant of ELM, called self-adaptive extreme learning machine (SaELM), is proposed. SaELM is a self-adaptive learning algorithm that can always select the best neuron number in hidden layer to form the neural networks. There is no need to adjust any parameters in the training process. In order to prove the performance of the SaELM, it is used to solve the Italian wine and iris classification problems. Through the comparisons between SaELM and the traditional back propagation, basic ELM and general regression neural network, the results have proven that SaELM has a faster learning speed and better generalization performance when solving the classification problem.

AB New technologies are increasingly becoming helpful tools for teaching-learning processes, due to their proven effectiveness and the ability to give a more didactic vision to education. The use of technological tools helps students to learn in a different way from the traditional one, being a motivational resource for the achievement of students' learning at any level of education.
   In this work, we propose an interactive visual interface that allows children to learn the learning process through the recognition of different types of animals. The system is based on machine learning, a programming technique in which algorithms learn from data sets. The system includes an image database with information about the different types of elements to identify. Through the proposed application, the user can select an option and the system interacting with him will indicate if the answer is correct or not. Additionally, this platform has a teacher's section, where it is possible to configure several options on the interface, such as changing the type of animal. All this, through a window that allows the user to customize the game in an easy and fast way. This interactive software has been developed in open source using C++ as programming language and Qt Creator to make the Graphical user interface (GUI).
   With this approach, we want to promote the idea of learning through playing, because the child has the possibility to learn new concepts and develop new skills through friendly games. Finally, several tests have been performed to measure the quality and performance of the GUI. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the tool in the students' learning and the possibility of new advances in this line.

AB Credit scoring process, the most important part in credit risk management, aims at estimating the probability that an applicant will perform bad credit behaviors (e.g., loan default). Managing and developing effective and reliable risk assessment procedures in order to mitigate potential loss caused by new applicants heavily relies on the performance of scoring process. Traditionally this process is manually developed, which is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated credit risk management process based on machine learning to ease the scoring process in order to reduce the human effort. This process is data driven: it leverages machine learning to automatically analyze vast amounts of historical data and build predictive model. We evaluate our process with a real-world proprietary dataset and achieved good performance, which shows the feasibility of using machine learning to facilitate the credit risk management process.

AB Over the past ten to fifteen years botnets have gained the attention of researchers worldwide. A great deal of effort has been given to developing systems that would efficiently and effectively detect the presence of a botnet. This unique problem saw researchers applying machine learning (ML) to solve this problem. In this paper we provide a brief overview the different machine learning ( ML) methods and the part they play in botnet detection. The main aim of this paper is to clearly define the role different ML methods play in Botnet detection. A clear understanding of these roles are critical for developing effective and efficient real-time online detection approaches and more robust models.

AB This paper presents a weighted minimum variance distortion-less response (WMVDR) algorithm for far-field sound source localization in a noisy environment. The broadband beam-forming is computed in the frequency-domain by calculating the response power on each frequency bin and by fusing the narrowband components. A machine learning method based on a support vector machine (SVM) is used for selecting only the narrowband components that positively contribute to the broadband fusion. We investigate the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation problem using a uniform linear array (ULA). The skewness measure of response power function is used as input feature for the supervised SVM learning. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the WMVDR in an outdoor noisy environment.

AB Human observer behaviour analysis in image and video inspection in many areas of practical application is conducted based on using data captured by eye tracking devices. Such data is analysed using statistical approaches leading to the creation of useful information and the ability to make decisions about the content. CCTV observer behaviour analysis is one example of a most widely used application. Unfortunately, the information and knowledge that such statistical approaches to data analysis can create is rather limited, especially the trends and patterns of data cannot be easily analysed. Thus, important information and knowledge that the data can provide may not be identifiable. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to human observer eye tracking data analysis based on machine learning algorithms. Further, in order to conduct a more detailed and practically useful data analysis, we specifically analyse the attention human observers given instructions to search for specified content. We provide experimental results to demonstrate the significance and novelty of the information and knowledge that this novel approach to data analysis can provide. To the authors' knowledge, there is no work in literature that has proposed the use of machine learning in eye tracking data analysis.

AB Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been widely used in solving multi-objective optimization problems. A great number of the-state-of-art MOEAs have been proposed. These MOEAs can be classified into the following categories: decomposition-based, domination-based, indicator-based, and probability-based methods. Among them, the first four categories belong to non-model based methods, while the fifth one is considered to be model-based method, in which machine learning techniques are often used to build the models. Recently, embedding machine learning mechanisms into MOEAs is becoming popular and promising. In this paper, a relatively thorough review on both traditional MOEAs and those equipped with machine learning mechanisms are made, with the aim of shedding light on the future development of this emerging research field.

AB Intrusion detection is facing great challenges as network attacks producing massive volumes of data are increasingly sophisticated and heterogeneous. In order to gain much more accurate and reliable detection results, machine learning and visualization techniques have been respectively applied to intrusion detection. In this paper, we review some important work related to machine learning and visualization techniques for intrusion detection. We present a collaborative analysis architecture for intrusion detection tasks which integrate both machine learning and visualization techniques into intrusion detection. We also discuss some significant issues related to the proposed collaborative analysis architecture.

AB Website privacy policies are often long, difficult to understand, and contain incomplete information. Consequently, users tend not to read the privacy policies, thus putting their privacy at risk. This paper describes an automated approach for assisting users to evaluate online privacy policies based on completeness. The term completeness refers to the presence of 8 sections in an online privacy policy that have been recognized as helpful in establishing the transparency of a privacy policy. Given a new online privacy policy, the proposed system employs a machine-learning based approach to predict a completeness score for the privacy policy. This score can then be used by the user to assess the risk to their privacy.

AB With multiple antennas' transmission, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique is able to utilize the space diversity to obtain high spectrum efficiency. In this study, we propose a single hidden layer feedforward network trained with extreme learning machine (ELM) to estimate channel performances in MIMO system. Bit error rate (BER) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance of back-propagation (BP) algorithm are also compared with our proposed neural network. The simulation results show that ELM has got much better time efficiency than BP in MIMO modeling. Furthermore, MIMO modeling based on ELM doesn't need to send pilot, which reduce the waste of spectrum resources.

These pollen observations were combined with machine learning and a very complete meteorological and land surface context of 85 variables to estimate the daily Ambrosia abundance. The machine learning algorithms employed were Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), neural networks, and random forests. The best performance was obtained using random forests. The physical insights provided by the random forest are also discussed.

AB During the last decade pathology has benefited from the rapid progress of image digitizing technologies, which led to the development of scanners, capable to produce so-called Whole Slide images (WSI) which can be explored by a pathologist on a computer screen comparable to the conventional microscope and can be used for diagnostics, research, archiving and also education and training. Digital pathology is not just the transformation of the classical microscopic analysis of histological slides by pathologists to just a digital visualization. It is a disruptive innovation that will dramatically change medical work-flows in the coming years and help to foster personalized medicine. Really powerful gets a pathologist if she/he is augmented by machine learning, e.g. by support vector machines, random forests and deep learning. The ultimate benefit of digital pathology is to enable to learn, to extract knowledge and to make predictions from a combination of heterogenous data, i.e. the histological image, the patient history and the *omics data. These challenges call for integrated/integrative machine learning approach fostering transparency, trust, acceptance and the ability to explain step-by-step why a decision has been made.

DE Machine learning; low frequency electromagnetic field; prediction
AB It is almost impossible to completely eliminate the effects of electromagnetic waves, but it is possible to reduce their effects. The use of machine learning is important to estimate these effects. Machine learning has been accelerating the upward trend over the last few years. It provides great advantages for problems that are difficult for human but easy to solve for machine. As a result, machine prediction is becoming increasingly popular. In this study, low frequency electromagnetic field values were measured in the buildings inside the campus and the output vector was tried to be estimated using machine learning. The results obtained by using linear regression, Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm and ridge regression models for estimation are evaluated.

AB Broadly speaking, supervised machine learning is the computational task of learning correlations between variables in annotated data (the training set), and using this information to create a predictive model capable of inferring annotations for new data, whose annotations are not known. Ageing is a complex process that affects nearly all animal species. This process can be studied at several levels of abstraction, in different organisms and with different objectives in mind. Not surprisingly, the diversity of the supervised machine learning algorithms applied to answer biological questions reflects the complexities of the underlying ageing processes being studied. Many works using supervised machine learning to study the ageing process have been recently published, so it is timely to review these works, to discuss their main findings and weaknesses. In summary, the main findings of the reviewed papers are: the link between specific types of DNA repair and ageing; ageing-related proteins tend to be highly connected and seem to play a central role in molecular pathways; ageing/longevity is linked with autophagy and apoptosis, nutrient receptor genes, and copper and iron ion transport. Additionally, several biomarkers of ageing were found by machine learning. Despite some interesting machine learning results, we also identified a weakness of current works on this topic: only one of the reviewed papers has corroborated the computational results of machine learning algorithms through wet-lab experiments. In conclusion, supervised machine learning has contributed to advance our knowledge and has provided novel insights on ageing, yet future work should have a greater emphasis in validating the predictions.

AB intelligent recommendations about where go will he very helpful for personal and commercial travel recommendations. We deal with this kind of recommendations as a prediction problem based on the tourist's historical visiting sequences and supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forests and LambdaMART. We propose a feature set with 56 dimensions from the tourist's historical traveling data. By utilizing the entropy from information theory, all features are ranked. Evaluation results show that when selecting the most important subset of 20 features as our final input of Random Forests, we can get a 4% higher accuracy and a 70% reduction of computation complexity with regard to using the full set of features. A comparison of five different machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forests, LambdaMART, Ranking SVM, ListNet and RankBoost, has been taken on this feature set, results demonstrate that the Random Forests outperforms the other algorithms.

AB Quantitative trading strategies are designed to look for relationships between data about an underlying security and its future price and then to generate alpha on a trading desk. Recent years have witnessed the increasing attention from both academic and corporate sectors on enhancing quantitative trading by machine learning techniques due to their excellent predictive powers, with a few successful stories from the markets further boosting optimism for this method of analysis. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive survey on the pilot study of applying machine learning for quantitative trading. We will review some earlier studies of using NNs and SVMs for stock price prediction. We will also touch some recent studies on designing online learning algorithms based on characteristics of financial time series, e.g., mean reversion of stock price. Another application of machine learning in quantitative trading is called meta-learning algorithm which considers how to assign weights to strategies. We will finally summarize the above research by pointing out promising machine learning techniques for different categories of trading strategies. We will also discuss slightly the potentials of machine learning techniques in helping generate strategies that do not only base on financial market data, like behavioral strategy, event-driven and untraditional index strategy.

AB Feature extraction plays an important role in brain computer interface system that significantly affects the success of brain signal classification. In this paper, a feature extraction method of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals based on Extreme Learning Machine auto-encoder (ELM-AE) is applied. Firstly, the original data is classified by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and the number of hidden layer's neuron with the highest accuracy is selected as the dimension of feature extraction. Then, ELM-AE's output weight learns to represent the features of the original data. Finally, the features are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Experiment result shows the efficiency of our method for both the speed of feature extraction and the accuracy of the classification for data set la, which is a typical representative of one kind of BCI competition 2003 data.

AB The various interplaying variables of tumor growth remain key questions in cancer research, in particular what makes such a growth malignant and what are possible therapies to stop the growth and prevent re-growth. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease, as well as the steadily growing set of publicly available big data sets, there is an urgent need for approaches to make sense out of these open data sets. Machine learning methods for tumor growth profiles and model validation can be of great help here, particularly, discrete multi-agent approaches.
   In this paper we provide an overview of current machine learning approaches used for cancer research with the main focus of highlighting the necessity of in silico tumor growth modeling.

AB Classification of structural brain magnetic resonance (MR) images is a crucial task for many neurological phenotypes that machine learning tools are increasingly developed and applied to solve this problem in recent years. In this study binary classification of T1-weighted structural brain MR images are performed using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms when there is no information about the clinical context or specifics of neuroimaging. Image derived features and clinical labels that are provided by the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention 2014 machine learning challenge are used. These morphological summary features are obtained from four different datasets (each N > 70) with clinically relevant phenotypes and automatically extracted from the MR imaging scans using FreeSurfer, a freely distributed brain MR image processing software package. Widely used machine learning tools, namely; back-propagation neural network, self-organizing maps, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors are used as classifiers. Clinical prediction accuracy is obtained via cross-validation on the training data (N = 150) and predictions are made on the test data (N = 100). Classification accuracy, the fraction of cases where prediction is accurate and area under the ROC curve are used as the performance metrics. Accuracy and area under curve metrics are used for tuning the training hyperparameters and the evaluation of the performance of the classifiers. Performed experiments revealed that support vector machines show a better success compared to the other methods on clinical predictions using summary morphological features in the absence of any information about the phenotype. Prediction accuracy would increase greatly if contextual information is integrated into the system. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB As we are usually confronted with a large instance space for real-word data sets, it is significant to develop a useful and efficient multiple-instance learning (MIL) algorithm. MIL, where training data are prepared in the form of labeled bags rather than labeled instances, is a variant of supervised learning. This paper presents a novel MIL algorithm for an extreme learning machine called MI-ELM. A radial basis kernel extreme learning machine is adapted to approach the MIL problem using Hausdorff distance to measure the distance between the bags. The clusters in the hidden layer are composed of bags that are randomly generated. Because we do not need to tune the parameters for the hidden layer, MI-ELM can learn very fast. The experimental results on classifications and multiple-instance regression data sets demonstrate that the MI-ELM is useful and efficient as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Latencies and delays play an important role in temporally precise robot control. During dynamic tasks in particular, a robot has to account for inherent delays to reach manipulated objects in time. The different types of occurring delays are typically convoluted and thereby hard to measure and separate. In this paper, we present a data-driven methodology for separating and modelling inherent delays during robot control. We show how both actuation and response delays can be modelled using modern machine learning methods. The resulting models can be used to predict the delays as well as the uncertainty of the prediction. Experiments on two widely used robot platforms show significant actuation and response delays in standard control loops. Predictive models can, therefore, be used to reason about expected delays and improve temporal accuracy during control. The approach can easily be used on different robot platforms.

AB Machine learning is the adaptive process that makes computers improve from experience, by example, and by analogy. So It is a discipline of methodologies that provides, in one form or another, intelligent information processing capabilities for handling real life. Bioinformatics is one of the application of Machine Learning. Bioinformatics is the interdisciplinary science of interpreting biological data using information technology and computer science. Machine learning (ML) focuses on automatic learning from data set. Machine learning includes the learning speed, the guarantee of convergence, and how the data can be learned incrementally. We usually refer to methods like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Genetic algorithms (GAs), and Fuzzy systems along with hybrid methods including a combination of some of these methods. One of the major problems is to classify the normal genes and the invalid genes which are infected by some kind of diseases. In genomic research, classifying DNA sequences into existing categories is used to learn the functions of a new protein. So, it is important to identify those genes and classify them. In order to identify the infected genes and the normal genes with the use of classification methods here we use the machine learning techniques. This paper gives a review on the mechanisms of gene sequence classification using Machine Learning techniques, which includes a brief detail on bioinformatics, literature survey and key issues in DNA Sequencing using Machine Learning.

AB With the prevalence of traumatic brain injury and associated motor function impairment, an advance in the capacity to measure the efficacy of a rehabilitation strategy is a topic of considerable interest. For example, the development of a rehabilitation system that can quantify the efficacy to an ankle dorsiflexion therapy prescription would be beneficial. An ankle rehabilitation system is presented that amalgamates multiple technologies, such as a smartphone ( iPhone) wireless gyroscope platform, machine learning, and 3D printing. The ankle rehabilitation system is produced by mostly 3D printing. A smartphone wireless gyroscope platform records the ankle rehabilitation system's therapy usage with wireless transmission to the Internet as an email attachment. The gyroscope signal data is processed for machine learning. A support vector machine attains 97% classification between a hemiplegic affected ankle and unaffected ankle feature set while using the ankle rehabilitation system. The application can be readily applied to a homebound setting of the subject's convenience.

AB As technology nodes continue shrinking, lithography hotspot detection has become a challenging task in the design flow. In this work we present a hybrid technique using pattern matching and machine learning engines for hotspot detection. In the training phase, we propose sampling techniques to correct for the hotspot/non-hotspot imbalance to improve the accuracy of the trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) system. In the detection phase, we have combined topological clustering and a novel pattern encoding technique based on pattern regularity to enhance the predictability of the system. Using the ICCAD 2012 benchmark data, our approach shows an accuracy of 88% in detecting hotspots with hit-to extra ratio of 0.12 which are better results compared to other published techniques using the same benchmark data.

AB Due to its much faster speed and better generalization performance, extreme learning machine (ELM) has attracted much attention as an effective learning approach. However, ELM rarely involves strategies for imbalanced data distributions which may exist in many fields. Existing approaches for imbalance learning only consider the effect of the number of the class samples ignoring the dispersion degree of the data, and may lead to the suboptimal learning results. In this paper, we will propose a novel ELM, class-specific cost regulation extreme learning machine (CCR-ELM), together with its kernel based extension, for binary and multiclass classification problems with imbalanced data distributions. CCR-ELM introduces class-specific regulation cost for misclassification of each class in the performance index as the tradeoff of structural risk and empirical risk. The performance of CCR-ELM is verified using a number of benchmark datasets and the real blast furnace status diagnosis problem. Experimental results show that CCR-ELM can achieve better performance for classification problems with imbalanced data distributions than the original ELM and existing ELM imbalance learning approach, and the kernel based CCR-ELM can improve the performance further.

AB Today, enterprise integration and cross-enterprise collaboration is becoming evermore important. The Internet of things, digitization and globalization are pushing continuous growth in the integration market. However, setting up integration systems today is still largely a manual endeavor. Most probably, future integration will need to leverage more automation in order to keep up with demand. This paper presents a first version of a system that uses tools from artificial intelligence and machine learning to ease the integration of information systems, aiming to automate parts of it. Three models are presented and evaluated for precision and recall using data from real, past, integration projects. The results show that it is possible to obtain F-0.5 scores in the order of 80% for models trained on a particular kind of data, and in the order of 60% - 70% for less specific models trained on a several kinds of data. Such models would be valuable enablers for integration brokers to keep up with demand, and obtain a competitive advantage. Future work includes fusing the results from the different models, and enabling continuous learning from an operational production system.

AB Object classification from images is an important task for machine vision and it is a crucial ingredient for many computer vision applications, ranging from security and surveillance to marketing. Image based object classification techniques properly integrate image processing and machine learning (i.e., classification) procedures. In this paper we present a system for automatic simultaneous optimization of algorithms and parameters for object classification from images. More specifically, the proposed system is able to process a dataset of labelled images and to return a best configuration of image processing and classification algorithms and of their parameters with respect to the accuracy of classification. Experiments with real public datasets are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed system.

AB This paper proposes a novel method by rethinking the method of moments (MoM) solving process into a machine learning training process. Based on the artificial neural network (ANN), the conventional MoM matrix is treated as the training data set, based on which machine learning training process becomes conventional linear algebra MoM solving process. The trained result is the solution of MoM. The multiple linear regression (MLR) is utilized to train the model. Amazon Web Service (AWS) is used as the computations platform to utilize the existing hardware and software resources for machine learning. To verify the feasibility of the proposed new machine learning based method of moments (ML-MoM), we choose the static parasitic capacitance extraction and dynamic electromagnetics scattering as examples. The proposed novel idea opens a new gateway between conventional computational electromagnetics and machine learning algorithms with various application potentials.

AB Support vector machines (SVMs) have played an important role in the state-of-the-art language recognition systems. The recently developed extreme learning machine (ELM) tends to have better scalability and achieve similar or much better generalization performance at much faster learning speed than traditional SVM. Inspired by the excellent feature of ELM, in this paper, we propose a novel method called regularized minimum class variance extreme learning machine (RMCVELM) for language recognition. The RMCVELM aims at minimizing empirical risk, structural risk, and the intra-class variance of the training data in the decision space simultaneously. The proposed method, which is computationally inexpensive compared to SVM, suggests a new classifier for language recognition and is evaluated on the 2009 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) language recognition evaluation (LRE). Experimental results show that the proposed RMCVELM obtains much better performance than SVM. In addition, the RMCVELM can also be applied to the popular i-vector space and get comparable results to the existing scoring methods.

AB We present an extensive review on the subject of machine learning by studying existing literature. We focus primarily on the main approaches that have been proposed in order to address the problem of machine learning and how they may be categorized according to type and amount of inference. Specifically, the categorization of the various machine learning paradigms according to the type of inference, involves the following two approaches:
   Model Identification or Parametric Inference; and
   Model Prediction or General Inference.
   The general framework of the parametric model, in particular, introduces the principles of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) and Structural Risk Minimization. On the other hand, the Transductive Inference Model is defined as an extension to the original paradigm of General Inference. The categorization of machine learning models according to the amount of inference includes the following approaches:
   Rote Learning;
   Learning from Instruction; and
   Learning from Examples.
   Specifically, Learning from Examples provides the framework to analyze the problem of minimizing a risk functional on a given set of empirical data which is the fundamental problem within the field of pattern recognition. In essence, the particular form of the risk functional defines the primary problems of machine learning, namely:
   The Classification Problem;
   The Regression Problem; and
   The Density Estimation Problem which is closely related to the Clustering Problem.
   Finally, in this chapter we present a conspectus of the theoretical foundations behind Statistical Learning Theory.

AB Concept generation and refinement is a process to generate and improve machine's knowledge base represented by a comprehensive set of formal concepts. An unsupervised algorithm for concept refinement is developed for autonomously upgrading and enhancing acquired concepts of knowledge in a cognitive knowledge base built by cognitive robots and systems. The concept refinement algorithm is implemented based on a set of rules of concept algebra and semantic analyses. Experimental results demonstrate that cognitive machines can autonomously refine their knowledge by improving acquired concepts in a dynamic process mimicking human learning mechanisms in deep machine learning and cognitive computing.

AB The research presented in this paper shows an adaptive approach for long-term thermal error compensation of 5-axis machine tools (MT). A system of differential equations is used to compute the model based compensation values. The model can predict thermal displacements of the tool center point (TCP) based on changes in the environmental temperature, load-dependent changes and boundary condition changes and states, like machining with or without cutting fluid. The model based compensation of the rotary axis of a 5-axis MT is then extended by on-machine measurements. The information gained by the process-intermittent probing is used to adaptively update the model parameters, so that the model learns how to predict thermal position and orientation errors and to maintain a small residual error of the thermally induced errors of the rotary axis over a long time. This approach not only increases the MT accuracy but also reduces the amount of time spent on preproduction model parameter identification. Additionally an algorithm has been developed to dynamically adjust the length of the on-machine measurement intervals to maintain a high productivity and a constant deviation of the machined parts.
   Experimental results confirm that the adaptive learning control (ALC) for thermal errors shows a desirable long-term prediction accuracy. (C) 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of machine learning is to solve a given problem using past experience or example data. Many machine learning applications are using now-a-days already. More aspiring problems can be handled as more data become accessible. Here. in this context we learn in detail about text mining as a multi-dimensional field which involves the closely linked areas or sections like 1. Retrieving information, 2. Machine learning concepts shortly termed as ML, 3. Statistics, 4. And finally Computational linguistics and specifically to be mentioned, data mining. With the use of sample data or previously gained experience, machine learning is included into computers to enhance or improve a performance decisive factor. In this context we have detailed a model up to some level of constraints, and learning is the processing of a main content to enhance the parameter of the form using the training or sample data or previously gained experience. This may be designed to gain knowledge from the given data, or use the effect for changes in the future, or both. These learning techniques also helps us to make solutions to various bugs which includes vision, speech recognition, and robotics. We take the example of the main analysis of preprocessing of tasks and procedures, then classification, then clustering, information extraction and finally visualization.

AB Machine learning methods have been applied to many data sets in pharmaceutical research for several decades. The relative ease and availability of fingerprint type molecular descriptors paired with Bayesian methods resulted in the widespread use of this approach for a diverse array of end points relevant to drug discovery. Deep learning is the latest machine learning algorithm attracting attention for many of pharmaceutical applications from docking to virtual screening. Deep learning is based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers and has found considerable traction for many artificial intelligence applications. We have previously suggested the need for a comparison of different machine learning methods with deep learning across an array of varying data sets that is applicable to pharmaceutical research. End points relevant to pharmaceutical research include absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/Tox) properties, as well as activity against pathogens and drug discovery data sets. In this study, we have used data sets for solubility, probe-likeness, hERG, KCNQ1, bubonic plague, Chagas, tuberculosis, and malaria to compare different machine learning methods using FCFP6 fingerprints. These data sets represent whole cell screens, individual proteins, physicochemical properties as well as a data set with a complex end point. Our aim was to assess whether deep learning offered any improvement in testing when assessed using an array of metrics including AUC, F1 score, Cohens kappa, Matthews correlation coefficient and others. Based on ranked normalized scores for the metrics or data sets Deep Neural Networks (DNN) ranked higher than SVM, which in turn was ranked higher than all the other machine learning methods. Visualizing these properties for training and test sets using radar type plots indicates when models are inferior or perhaps over trained. These results also suggest the need for assessing deep learning further using multiple metrics with much larger scale comparisons, prospective testing as well as assessment of different fingerprints and DNN architectures beyond those used.

AB Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are emerging as hardware primitives for key-generation and light-weight authentication. Strong PUFs represent a variant of PUFs which respond to a user challenge with a response determined by its unique manufacturing process variations. Unfortunately many of the Strong PUFs have been shown to be vulnerable to model building attacks when an attacker has access to challenge and response pairs. In mounting a model building attack, typically machine learning is used to build a software model to forge the PUF. Researchers have long been interested in designing Strong PUFs that are resistant to model building attacks. However, with innovations in application of machine learning, nearly all Strong PUFs presented in the literature have been broken. In this paper, first we present results from a set of experiments designed to show that if certain randomness properties can be met, cascaded structure based Strong PUFs can indeed be made machine learning (ML) attack resistant against known ML attacks. Next we conduct machine learning experiments on an abstract PUF model using Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Bagging, Boosting and Evolutionary techniques to establish criteria for machine learning resistant Strong PUF design. This paper does not suggest how to harvest the process variation, which remains within the purview of a circuit designer; rather it suggests what properties of the building blocks to aim for towards building a machine learning resistant Strong PUF thus paving the path for a systematic design approach.

AB "Big data" on atrocities events are now widely analyzed in the social sciences. Unfortunately, these data often contain incomplete information on the identities of atrocity perpetrators. This study addresses this deficiency by developing a machine learning approach for the accurate recovery of unknown perpetrator identities within existent atrocities datasets. In doing so, it demonstrates how to transform and standardize a large number of auxiliary variables into text-compatible data. It next shows how to leverage this information to train a series of classifiers on observed atrocities data. After identifying the ideal set of machine learning algorithms and evaluating their performance in this context, this study then uses an ensemble of the best performing algorithms to classify all unknown atrocity perpetrators included within a prominent atrocities dataset, validating the results with external data from the Iraq conflict.

AB We present a fiber tractography approach based on a random forest classification and voting process, guiding each step of the streamline progression by directly processing raw diffusion-weighted signal intensities. For comparison to the state-of-the-art, i. e. tractography pipelines that rely on mathematical modeling, we performed a quantitative and qualitative evaluation with multiple phantom and in vivo experiments, including a comparison to the 96 submissions of the ISMRM tractography challenge 2015. The results demonstrate the vast potential of machine learning for fiber tractography.

AB Previous research focusing on the evaluation of transfer learning algorithms has predominantly used real-world datasets to measure an algorithm's performance. A test with a real-world dataset exposes an algorithm to a single instance of distribution difference between the training (source) and test (target) datasets. These previous works have not measured performance over a wide-range of source and target distribution differences. We propose to use a test framework that creates many source and target datasets from a single base dataset, representing a diverse-range of distribution differences. These datasets will be used as a stress test to measure an algorithm's performance. The stress test process will measure and compare different transfer learning algorithms and traditional learning algorithms. The unique contributions of this paper, with respect to transfer learning, are defining a test framework, defining multiple distortion profiles, defining a stress test suite, and the evaluation and comparison of different transfer learning and traditional machine learning algorithms over a wide-range of distributions.

AB Artificial intelligence products are already around us and will be emerging dramatically a lot in near future. Artificial intelligence is all about data analysis. When it comes to data analysis, there are two representative techniques: machine learning and semantic technology. They stand on the other side from where to begin analysis. Simply speaking, machine learning is based on the data while semantic technology relies on human domain knowledge (human learning). What if collected data are insufficient to reflect whole phenomenon? This is a limitation of machine learning. What if circumstance changes a lot as time goes by? Manual rule updating by experts is not a good solution in that circumstance. Based on these observations, we investigate two approaches and find a good solution which maximizes the advantages of both techniques and mitigates the limitations of them. This paper suggests a novel integration idea to compensate each technology with the other: that is semantic filtering. This paper includes a toy semantic modelling and a machine learning algorithm implementation to realize the proposed concept, semantic filtering.

AB As a knowledge discovery in internet, data mining technology is the cross of machine learning and databases technology. Data mining can provide massive amounts of data analysis using machine learning techniques and manage massive amounts of data by the use of database technology. The goal of machine learning is to simulate and realize human learning behavior in order to optimize a performance criterion using past experience and example data. Two kinds of internet data mining technologies which include rank learning and topic model learning are introduced in this paper. As a supervised learning sorting method, the task of rank learning is sorting the retrieved pages for a given query. As a Bayesian model, topic model learning is designed to automatically extract all possible topics and each topic page from the index page, so that the web page and query statement can match on the topic. The latest researches about above areas are reviewed.

AB Objectives: Government public health expenditure data sets require time- and labor-intensive manipulation to summarize results that public health policy makers can use. Our objective was to compare the performances of machine-learning algorithms with manual classification of public health expenditures to determine if machines could provide a faster, cheaper alternative to manual classification.
   Methods: We used machine-learning algorithms to replicate the process of manually classifying state public health expenditures, using the standardized public health spending categories from the Foundational Public Health Services model and a large data set from the US Census Bureau. We obtained a data set of 1.9 million individual expenditure items from 2000 to 2013. We collapsed these data into 147280 summary expenditure records, and we followed a standardized method of manually classifying each expenditure record as public health, maybe public health, or not public health. We then trained 9 machine-learning algorithms to replicate the manual process. We calculated recall, precision, and coverage rates to measure the performance of individual and ensembled algorithms.
   Results: Compared with manual classification, the machine-learning random forests algorithm produced 84% recall and 91% precision. With algorithm ensembling, we achieved our target criterion of 90% recall by using a consensus ensemble of >= 6 algorithms while still retaining 93% coverage, leaving only 7% of the summary expenditure records unclassified.
   Conclusions: Machine learning can be a time- and cost-saving tool for estimating public health spending in the United States. It can be used with standardized public health spending categories based on the Foundational Public Health Services model to help parse public health expenditure information from other types of health-related spending, provide data that are more comparable across public health organizations, and evaluate the impact of evidence-based public health resource allocation.

AB Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse class of well-studied membrane-permeating peptides with important functions in innate host defense. In this short review, we provide a historical overview of AMPs, summarize previous applications of machine learning to AMPs, and discuss the results of our studies in the context of the latest AMP literature. Much work has been recently done in leveraging computational tools to design new AMP candidates with high therapeutic efficacies for drug-resistant infections. We show that machine learning on AMPs can be used to identify essential physicochemical determinants of AMP functionality, and identify and design peptide sequences to generate membrane curvature. In a broader scope, we discuss the implications of our findings for the discovery of membrane-active peptides in general, and uncovering membrane activity in new and existing peptide taxonomies.

DE Flash SSD; Machine Learning; Load balancing
AB Flash memory based solid state drives(SSDs) have alleviated the I/O bottleneck by exploiting its data parallel design. In an enterprise environment, Flash SSD used in the form of a hybrid storage architecture to achieve the better performance with lower cost. In this architecture, I/O load balancing is one of the important factors. However, the internal parallelism distorts the performance measures of the flash SSDs. Despite the criticality of load balancing on I/O intensive environments, these studies have rarely been addressed. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of applying classification method using machine learning techniques to the I/O saturation estimation by using Linux kernel I/O statistics instead of the utilization measure that is currently used for HDDs. We conclude that machine learning techniques that we employed (Support Vector Machine and LASSO Generalized Linear Model) performs well compared to the existing utilization measure even we cannot collect the internal information of the flash SSDs.

   Introduction
AB Force is considered to be one of the indicators that best describe the machining process. Measured force can be used to evaluate the quality and geometric profile of the machined part. In this paper, a combinatorial optimization approach is used to characterize the effect of force on the quality of a machined part made of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) material. The approach is called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) and is based on machine learning and pattern recognition. LAD is used in order to map the machining conditions, in terms of force and torque that lead to conforming products and those which lead to nonconforming products. In this paper, the LAD technique is applied to the drilling of CFRP plates, and the results, based on data obtained experimentally, are reported. A discussion of the potential use of LAD in manufacturing concludes the paper.

AB The detection of design patterns is a useful activity giving support to the comprehension and maintenance of software systems. Many approaches and tools have been proposed in the literature providing different results. In this paper, we extend a previous work regarding the application of machine learning techniques for design pattern detection, by adding a more extensive experimentation and enhancements in the analysis method. Here we exploit a combination of graph matching and machine learning techniques, implemented in a tool we developed, called MARPLE-DPD. Our approach allows the application of machine learning techniques, leveraging a modeling of design patterns that is able to represent pattern instances composed of a variable number of classes. We describe the experimentations for the detection of five design patterns on 10 open source software systems, compare the performances obtained by different learning models with respect to a baseline, and discuss the encountered issues.

AB In this paper, we introduce an interactive approach to generation of factual questions from unstructured text. Our proposed framework transforms input text into structured set of features and uses them for question generation. Its learning process is based on combination of machine learning techniques known as reinforcement learning and supervised learning. Learning process starts with initial set of pairs formed by declarative sentences and assigned questions and it continuously learns how to transform sentences into questions. Process is also improved by feedback from users regarding already generated questions. We evaluated our approach and the comparison with state-of-the-art systems shows that it is a perspective way for research.

AB There is no doubt that big data are now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains. While the potential of these massive data is undoubtedly significant, fully making sense of them requires new ways of thinking and novel learning techniques to address the various challenges. In this paper, we present a literature survey of the latest advances in researches on machine learning for big data processing. First, we review the machine learning techniques and highlight some promising learning methods in recent studies, such as representation learning, deep learning, distributed and parallel learning, transfer learning, active learning, and kernel-based learning. Next, we focus on the analysis and discussions about the challenges and possible solutions of machine learning for big data. Following that, we investigate the close connections of machine learning with signal processing techniques for big data processing. Finally, we outline several open issues and research trends.

AB Now-a-days breast cancer has become one of the leading cause of cancer death among women. This cancer is caused mostly due to the lifestyle changes, avoiding breast feeding etc. Detecting breast cancer takes long time due to manual diagnosis. Even though there are many diagnostic systems are available still, it takes more time for proper classification. For detecting breast cancer, mostly machine learning techniques are used. This work deals with the comparative study of Relevance vector machine(RVM) which provides Low computational cost while comparing with other machine learning techniques which are used for breast cancer detection. The aim of this work is to compare and explain how RVM is better than other machine learning algorithms for diagnosing breast cancer even the variables are reduced.

AB Feature significance plays an important role in the classification tasks. The performance of a classifier would be degraded due to the existence of the irrelevant features, which are often inevitable in the real applications. In order to distinguish the impacts implicated in the features and improve the performances of the classification methods, this paper presents a hybrid learning approach, entitled evolutionary extreme learning machine based weighted nearest-neighbor equality algorithm (EE-WNNE). In such method, the measure of the significance levels of the features are induced by the weights on the related links associated with the individual input nodes in the evolutionary extreme learning machine (E-ELM) algorithm. These feature weights are utilized to implement a weighted nearest-neighbor equality method to perform the subsequent classification tasks. Systematic experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach generally outperform many state-of-the-art classification techniques.

AB Deep learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proved to be very effective in feature extraction and representation of images. For image classification problems, this work aims at exploring the capability of extreme learning machine on high-level deep features of images. Additionally, motivated by the biological learning mechanism of ELM, in this paper, an adaptive extreme learning machine (AELM) method is proposed for handling cross-task (domain) learning problems, without loss of its nature of randomization and high efficiency. The proposed AELM is an extension of ELM from single task to cross task learning, by introducing a new error term and Laplacian graph based manifold regularization term in objective function. We have discussed the nearest neighbor, support vector machines and extreme learning machines for image classification under deep convolutional activation feature representation. Specifically, we adopt 4 benchmark object recognition datasets from multiple sources with domain bias for evaluating different classifiers. The deep features of the object dataset are obtained by a well-trained CNN with five convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers on ImageNet. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AELM is comparable and effective in single and multiple domains based recognition tasks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose a general framework for Extreme Learning Machine via free sparse transfer representation, which is referred to as transfer free sparse representation based on extreme learning machine (TFSR-ELM). This framework is suitable for different assumptions related to the divergence measures of the data distributions, such as a maximum mean discrepancy and K-L divergence. We propose an effective sparse regularization for the proposed free transfer representation learning framework, which can decrease the time and space cost. Different solutions to the problems based on the different distribution distance estimation criteria and convergence analysis are given. Comprehensive experiments show that TFSR-based algorithms outperform the existing transfer learning methods and are robust to different sizes of training data.

AB Since extreme learning machine (ELM) was proposed, it has been found that some hidden nodes in ELM may play a very minor role in the network output. To avoid this problem, enhanced random search based incremental extreme learning machine (EI-ELM) is proposed. However, we find that the EI-ELM's training time is too long. In addition, EI-ELM can only add hidden nodes one by one. This paper proposes a fast method for EI-ELM (referred to as FI-ELM). At each learning step, several hidden nodes are randomly generated and the hidden nodes selected by the multiresponse sparse regression (MRSR) are added to the existing network. The output weights of the network are updated by a fast iterative method. The experimental results show that compared with EI-ELM, FI-ELM spends less time on training. Taking this advantage, FI-ELM can generate more hidden nodes to find the hidden node leading to larger residual error decreasing.

AB The extreme learning machine (ELM), which was originally proposed for "generalized" single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks, provides efficient unified learning solutions for the applications of clustering, regression, and classification. It presents competitive accuracy with superb efficiency in many applications. However, ELM with subnetwork nodes architecture has not attracted much research attentions. Recently, many methods have been proposed for supervised/unsupervised dimension reduction or representation learning, but these methods normally only work for one type of problem. This paper studies the general architecture of multilayer ELM (ML-ELM) with subnetwork nodes, showing that: 1) the proposed method provides a representation learning platform with unsupervised/supervised and compressed/sparse representation learning and 2) experimental results on ten image datasets and 16 classification datasets show that, compared to other conventional feature learning methods, the proposed ML-ELM with subnetwork nodes performs competitively or much better than other feature learning methods.

AB The idea of brain machine interface (BMI) is to provide a source of interaction between a person and a machine via thought. Three major parts to an effective BMI are determined and handled in this paper: classifying a thought, doing a useful activity, and providing an efficient user interface (UI). This paper proposes an effective way of classifying thoughts and an approach for providing useful activities given a sequence of signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying a number of different thoughts when given a relatively small amount of training samples from a 5-channel EEG headset. We transform the electroencephalograph (EEG) data to a set of features for the input of the ELM model by estimating the logarithmic power (LP) of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which corresponds to five different frequency bands. The ELM provides up to a 90% to 100% classification accuracy depending on training samples and number of hidden nodes, compared to 52% to 60% for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We also present a UI based on a state machine design that allows a person to accomplish certain activities via thought with a robotic arm.

DE Extreme learning machine; Large scale learning; Online sequential
   learning; Mapreduce; Parallel classification
AB In this age of big data, analyzing big data is a very challenging problem. MapReduce is a simple, scalable and fault-tolerant data processing framework that enables us to process a massive volume of data. Many machine learning algorithms have been designed based on MapReduce, but there are only a few works related to parallel extreme learning machine (ELM) which is a fast and accurate learning algorithm.
   Online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is one of improved ELM algorithms to support online sequential learning efficiently. In this paper, we first analyze the dependency relationships of matrix calculations of OS-ELM, then propose a parallel online sequential extreme learning machine (POS-ELM) based on MapReduce.
   POS-ELM is evaluated with real and synthetic data with the maximum number of training data 1280 K and the maximum number of attributes 128. The experimental results show that the training accuracy and testing accuracy of POS-ELM are at the same level as those of OS-ELM and ELM, and it has good scalability with regard to the number of training data and the number of attributes. Compared to original ELM and OS-ELM where the capability to process large scale data is bounded by the limitation of resources within a single processing unit, POS-ELM can deal with much larger scale data. The larger the number of training data is, the higher the speedup of POS-ELM is. It can be concluded that POS-ELM has more powerful capability than both ELM and OS-ELM for large scale learning.

AB Automatic extraction of definitional contexts has been a problem that deserved to be addressed to in different studies by applications demands in the Natural Language Processing. The first approach to the automatic extraction of these resources has been through specific linguistic patterns, but this approach requires previous extensive linguistic knowledge and a thorough previous work. A model machine learning, on the other hand, reduces the work and, as we believe, can improve the results obtained with only one approach based on linguistic rules. Here experiments for extraction/classification of definitional contexts with naive bayes classifier and SVM are presented. We show that through machine learning approaches we can improve the results of this specific task. The highest result was obtained by the naive bayes classifier with back-off as smoothing.

AB Determinism is a key concern in the certification of software for safety-critical systems. In this paper, we evaluate the role of determinism in certification standards, using airborne software as example. We analyze and speculate how the requirements and underlying concepts related to determinism can be adapted for Machine Learning algorithms.
   In addition, we systematically identify and analyze a large set of factors that contribute to variations of behavior in machine learning systems across multiple levels. Our suggestion is that such variability factors are handled in a similar fashion to failure modes in current software and systems development.
   We propose that the method followed and the identified set of factors is taken as a step towards a global catalog that can assist both developers and assessors in attaining certifiable machine learning systems.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an answer to an increasing demand for a low-cost learning algorithm to handle big data applications. Nevertheless, existing ELMs leave four uncharted problems: complexity, uncertainty, concept drifts, curse of dimensionality. To correct these issues, a novel incremental meta-cognitive ELM, namely Evolving Type-2 Extreme Learning Machine (eT2ELM), is proposed. eT2ELM is built upon the three pillars of meta-cognitive learning, namely what-to-learn, how-to-learn, when-to-learn, where the notion of ELM is implemented in the how-to-learn component. On the other hand, eT2ELM is driven by a generalized interval type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) as the cognitive constituent, where the interval type-2 multivariate Gaussian function is used in the hidden layer, whereas the nonlinear Chebyshev function is embedded in the output layer. The efficacy of eT2ELM is proven with four data streams possessing various concept drifts, comparisons with prominent classifiers, and statistical tests, where eT2ELM demonstrates the most encouraging learning performances in terms of accuracy and complexity.

Extreme learning machine can be used to solve the classification problem, but its classification accuracy is not good enough. In this paper, we proposed an improved firefly algorithm called IFA and use it to select the parameters in ELM. Experimental results showed that the IFA can solve the premature problem and the classification ability of ELM can be improved by the use of IFA.

AB Machine learning has found widespread implementations and applications in many different domains in our life. However, as the big data era is coming, some traditional machine learning techniques cannot satisfy the requirements of real-time processing for large volumes of data. In response, machine learning needs to reinvent itself for big data. In this article, we provide a review of machine learning for big data processing in recent studies. Firstly, a discussion about big data is presented, followed by the analysis of the new characteristics of machine learning in the context of big data. Then, we propose a feasible reference framework for dealing with big data based on machine learning techniques. Finally, several research challenges and open issues are addressed.

DE Object detection; random ferns; machine learning
AB A machine-learning-based algorithm for detecting a moving object is proposed in this paper. It is composed of an object-detection model, and a machine-learning model. The object-detection model is used to detect the object by applying the random ferns method, while the machine-learning model is used to maintain the object expression in the object detecting model by online learning. Using the proposed algorithm, a moving object can be detected in real-time environment with robustness, such as illumination change, highspeed motion, object occlusion, object distortion, and noisy object. The effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by experiments in comparison with other models.

ID HEALTH-INSURANCE; SELECTION; MARKETS
AB Objective. To introduce cross-validation and a nonparametric machine learning framework for plan payment risk adjustment and then assess whether they have the potential to improve risk adjustment.
   Data Sources. 2011-2012 Truven MarketScan database.
   Study Design. We compare the performance of multiple statistical approaches within a broad machine learning framework for estimation of risk adjustment formulas. Total annual expenditure was predicted using age, sex, geography, inpatient diagnoses, and hierarchical condition category variables. The methods included regression, penalized regression, decision trees, neural networks, and an ensemble super learner, all in concert with screening algorithms that reduce the set of variables considered. The performance of these methods was compared based on cross-validated R-2.
   Principal Findings. Our results indicate that a simplified risk adjustment formula selected via this nonparametric framework maintains much of the efficiency of a traditional larger formula. The ensemble approach also outperformed classical regression and all other algorithms studied.
   Conclusions. The implementation of cross-validated machine learning techniques provides novel insight into risk adjustment estimation, possibly allowing for a simplified formula, thereby reducing incentives for increased coding intensity as well as the ability of insurers to "game" the system with aggressive diagnostic upcoding.

AB A learning environment generates massive knowledge by means of the services provided in MOOCs. Such knowledge is produced via learning actor interactions. This result is a motivation for researchers to put forward solutions for big data usage, depending on learning analytics techniques as well as the big data techniques relating to the educational field. In this context, the present article unfolds a uniform model to facilitate the exploitation of the experiences produced by the interactions of the pedagogical actors. The aim of proposing the said model is to make a unified analysis of the massive data generated by learning actors. This model suggests making an initial pre-processing of the massive data produced in an e-learning system, and it's subsequently intends to produce machine learning, defined by rules of measures of actors knowledge relevance. All the processing stages of this model will be introduced in an algorithm that results in the production of learning actor knowledge tree.

AB Background: Proteomics endeavors to study the structures, functions and interactions of proteins. Information of the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps to improve our knowledge of the functions and the 3D structures of proteins. Thus determining the PPIs is essential for the study of the proteomics.
   Objective: In this review, in order to study the application of machine learning in predicting PPI, some machine learning approaches such as support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forest (RF) were selected, and the examples of its applications in PPIs were listed.
   Results: SVM and RF are two commonly used methods. Nowadays, more researchers predict PPIs by combining more than two methods.
   Conclusion: This review presents the application of machine learning approaches in predicting PPI. Many examples of success in identification and prediction in the area of PPI prediction have been discussed, and the PPIs research is still in progress.

DE Automata processor; Machine learning; Random forest
AB A variety of applications employ ensemble learning models, using a collection of decision trees, to quickly and accurately classify an input based on its vector of features. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of such a method, namely Random Forests, as the first machine learning algorithm to be executed on the Automata Processor (AP). The AP is an upcoming reconfigurable co-processor accelerator which supports the execution of numerous automata in parallel against a single input data-flow. Owing to this execution model, our approach is fundamentally different, translating Random Forest models from existing memory-bound tree-traversal algorithms to pipelined designs that use multiple automata to check all of the required thresholds independently and in parallel. We also describe techniques to handle floating-point feature values which are not supported in the native hardware, pipelining of the execution stages, and compression of automata for the fastest execution times. The net result is a solution which when evaluated using two applications, namely handwritten digit recognition and sentiment analysis, produce up to 63 and 93 times speed-up respectively over single-core state-of-the-art CPU-based solutions. We foresee these algorithmic techniques to be useful not only in the acceleration of other applications employing Random Forests, but also in the implementation of other machine learning methods on this novel architecture.

AB Fully connected multi layer neural networks such as Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM) performs better than fully connected single layer neural networks in image classification tasks and has a smaller number of hidden layer neurons than Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based fully connected multi layer neural networks such as Multi Layer ELM (ML-ELM) and Hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) However, ML-ELM and H-ELM has a smaller training time than DBM. This paper introduces a fully connected multi layer neural network referred to as Multi Layer Multi Objective Extreme Learning Machine (MLMO-ELM) which uses a multi objective formulation to pass the label and non-linear information in order to learn a network model which has a similar number of hidden layer parameters as DBM and smaller training time than DBM. The experimental results show that MEMO-ELM outperforms DBM, ML-ELM and H-ELM on OCR and NORB datasets.

AB Understanding epigenetic processes holds immense promise for medical applications. Advances in Machine Learning (ML) are critical to realize this promise. Previous studies used epigenetic data sets associated with the germline transmission of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and novel ML approaches to predict genome-wide locations of critical epimutations. A combination of Active Learning (ACL) and Imbalanced Class Learning (ICL) was used to address past problems with ML to develop a more efficient feature selection process and address the imbalance problem in all genomic data sets. The power of this novel ML approach and our ability to predict epigenetic phenomena and associated disease is suggested. The current approach requires extensive computation of features over the genome. A promising new approach is to introduce Deep Learning (DL) for the generation and simultaneous computation of novel genomic features tuned to the classification task. This approach can be used with any genomic or biological data set applied to medicine. The application of molecular epigenetic data in advanced machine learning analysis to medicine is the focus of this review.

AB In 2014, 39 % of adults were overweight, and 13 % were obese. Clearly, knowing exact energy expenditure (EE) is important for sports training and weight control. Furthermore, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) must be included in the total EE. This paper presents a machine learning-based EE estimation approach with EPOC for aerobic exercise using a heart rate sensor. On a dataset acquired from 33 subjects, we apply machine learning algorithms using Weka machine learning toolkit. We could achieve 0.88 correlation and 0.23 kcal/min root mean square error (RMSE) with linear regression. The proposed model could be applied to various wearable devices such as a smartwatch.

AB The purpose of this paper is to understand various problems related to Computer Science and find solutions from optimized machine learning algorithm by realizing machine learning API and API server. The representative machine-learning algorithm, TensorFlow, need to express algorithm from the stage of nodes and edges while IBM Watson only uses functions in completed form. Those are the problems to be solved in this paper; therefore, we suggest low-level API, which is in the middle stage between TensorFlow and IBM Watson and realize the low-level API. The machine learning API is realized in machine learning of artificial neural network and stochastic shunt, which will be applicable in other areas.

AB Traditional diagnoses on addiction reply on the patients' self-reports, which are easy to be dampened by false memory or malingering. Machine learning (ML) is a data-driven procedure that learns algorithms from training data and makes predictions. It is quickly developed and is more and more utilized into clinical applications including diagnoses of addiction. This chapter reviewed the basic concepts and processes of ML. Some studies utilizing ML to classify addicts and non-addicts, separate different types of addiction, and evaluate the effects of treatment are also reviewed. Both advantages and shortcomings of ML in diagnoses of addiction are discussed.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and its variants have been widely used for many applications due to its fast convergence and good generalization performance. Though the distributed ELM* based on MapReduce framework can handle very large scale training dataset in big data applications, how to cope with its rapidly updating is still a challenging task. Therefore, in this paper, a novel Elastic Extreme Learning Machine based on MapReduce framework, named Elastic ELM ((ELM)-L-2), is proposed to cover the shortage of ELM* whose learning ability is weak to the updated large-scale training dataset. Firstly, after analyzing the property of ELM* adequately, it can be found out that its most computation-expensive part, matrix multiplication, can be incrementally, decrementally and correctionally calculated. Next, the Elastic ELM based on MapReduce framework is developed, which first calculates the intermediate matrix multiplications of the updated training data subset, and then update the matrix multiplications by modifying the old matrix multiplications with the intermediate ones. Then, the corresponding new output weight vector can be obtained with centralized computing using the update the matrix multiplications. Therefore, the efficient learning of rapidly updated massive training dataset can be realized effectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic data to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed (ELM)-L-2 in learning massive rapidly updated training dataset with various experimental settings.

AB Recently many industries and companies are developing machine learning algorithms and services, and they are publishing them on the internet. However, because most of people who want to use the machine learning services to analyze data are familiar with sheet data rather than programming language, it is difficult to use those services written in programming language. For the reason, we developed a machine learning web service using spreadsheets for non-programmers. We introduce the service and with another similar service which is using other interface and other machine learning algorithm.

AB As data keeps growing, Big Data starts to be everywhere, and there is almost an urgent need to make sense of this data. This is why Machine Learning has become crucial as it aids in improving business, decision making and it has the potential to provide solutions for a wide range of problems in computer science and other fields. Machine Learning (a.k.a. Data Mining or Predictive Analytics) algorithms can learn how to perform certain tasks by generalizing from the out of sample examples. This is a totally different paradigm than traditional programming language approaches based on writing programs that process data to produce an output. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a particular application requires substantial amount of effort that is even hard to undertake even with text books. In order to reduce the effort, this paper introduces a recommender system that will aid machine learning researchers and practitioners to choose the optimum machine learning model to use. The system is based on an approach that is introduced in the paper called TCDC which stands for Train, Compare, Decide, and Change.

ID PREDICTION
AB A major milestone in modern biology was the complete sequencing of the human genome. But it produced a whole set of new challenges in exploring the functions and interactions of different parts of the genome. One application is predicting disorders based on mining the genotype and understanding how the interactions between genetic loci lead to certain human diseases.
   However, typically disease phenotypes are genetically complex. They are characterized by large, high-dimensional data sets. Also, usually the sample size is small.
   Recently machine learning and predictive modeling approaches have been successfully applied to understand the genotype-phenotype relations and link them to human diseases. They are well suited to overcome the problems of the large data sets produced by the human genome and its high-dimensionality. Machine learning techniques have been applied in virtually all data mining domains and have proven to be effective in BioData mining as well. This paper describes some of the techniques that have been adopted in recent studies in human genome analysis.

ID FACE RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM
AB In recent years, a great deal of research has focused on the sparse representation for signal. Particularly, a dictionary learning algorithm, K-SVD, is introduced to efficiently learn an redundant dictionary from a set of training signals. Indeed, much progress has been made in different aspects. In addition, there is an interesting technique named extreme learning machine (ELM), which is an single-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs) with a fast learning speed, good generalization and universal classification capability. In this paper, we propose an optimization method about K-SVD, which is an denoising deep extreme learning machines based on autoencoder (DDELM-AE) for sparse representation. In other words, we gain a new learned representation through the DDELM-AE and as the new "input", it makes the conventional K-SVD algorithm perform better. To verify the classification performance of the new method, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world data sets. The performance of the deep models (i.e., Stacked Autoencoder) is comparable. The experimental results indicate the fact that our proposed method is very efficient in the sight of speed and accuracy.

ID SELECTION
AB Extreme Learning machines (ELM) and Support Vector Machines have become two of the most widely used machine learning techniques for both classification and regression problems of recent. However the comparison of both ELM and SVM for classification and regression problems has often caught the attention of several researchers. In this work, an attempt has been made at investigating how SVM and ELM compared on the unique and important problem of Email spam detection, which is a classification problem. The importance of email in this present age cannot be overemphasized. Hence the need to promptly and accurately detect and isolate unsolicited mails through spam detection system cannot be over emphasized. Empirical results from experiments carried out using very popular dataset indicated that both techniques outperformed the best earlier published techniques on the same popular dataset employed in this study. However, SVM performed better than ELM on comparison scale based on accuracy. But in term of speed of operation, ELM outperformed SVM significantly.

AB Diabatic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading cause of sight inefficiency for diabetic patients. The clinical diagnostic results and several outcome of eye testing methods reviled a set of observations that eases the decision making in the case of diabetic retinopathy for the doctor, therapist. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence is applied in clinical data analytic as it can detect patterns in data, and then use these uncovered patterns to predict future data or perform some kind of decision making under uncertainty. In case of DR finding the co-relation between the depth of affection and the clinical result is very much critical, as several parameters are need to be taken into consideration for optimal decision making by the therapist. In this paper we have reviewed the performance of a set of machine learning algorithms and verify their performance for a particular DR data set.

AB It is well known that in supervised learning, active learning could effectively decrease the complexity of training instances without obvious loss of the classification performance. Generally, active learning is applied in the scenario that lots of instances are easy to be acquired, but labeling them is expensive and/or time-consuming. In this study, we try to implement active learning by using extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier based on three reasons as follows: (1) ELM has light computational costs, (2) ELM has strong generalization ability which is even comparable with support vector machine (SVM) and (3) ELM could be directly applied on both binary-class and multiclass problems. Specifically, an active learning algorithm based on ELM classifier named AL-ELM is proposed in this paper. During active learning, AL-ELM estimates the uncertainty of each unlabeled instance by creating a mapping relation between the actual outputs of the instance in ELM and the approximated membership probability of the same instance. In other words, ELM is converted as the equivalent Bayes classifier. On each iteration, those most uncertain instances are extracted and labeled to promote the quality of classification model. The learning procedure stops until it satisfies a pre-designed criterion. Experimental results on 20 benchmark data sets show that AL-ELM is better than or at least comparable to several state-of-the-art uncertainty-based active learning algorithms. Also, in contrast with several other algorithms, AL-ELM could effectively decrease the running time of learning procedure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An active machine learning technique for monitoring the voltage stability in transmission systems is presented. It has been shown that machine learning algorithms may be used to supplement the traditional simulation approach, but they suffer from the difficulties of online machine learning model update and offline training data preparation. We propose an active learning solution to enhance existing machine learning applications by actively interacting with the online prediction and offline training process. The technique identifies operating points where machine learning predictions based on power system measurements contradict with actual system conditions. By creating the training set around the identified operating points, it is possible to improve the capability of machine learning tools to predict future power system states. The technique also accelerates the offline training process by reducing the amount of simulations on a detailed power system model around operating points where correct predictions are made. Experiments show a significant advantage in relation to the training time, prediction time, and number of measurements that need to be queried to achieve high prediction accuracy.

AB The development of new microscopy techniques for super-resolved, long-term monitoring of cellular and sub cellular dynamics in living organisms is revealing new fundamental aspects of tissue development and repair. However, new microscopy approaches present several challenges. In addition to unprecedented requirements for data storage, the analysis of high resolution, time-lapse images is too complex to be done manually. Machine learning techniques are ideally suited for the (semi-)automated analysis of multidimensional image data. In particular, support vector machines (SVMs), have emerged as an efficient method to analyze microscopy images obtained from animals. Here, we discuss the use of SVMs to analyze in vivo microscopy data. We introduce the mathematical framework behind SVMs, and we describe the metrics used by SVMs and other machine learning approaches to classify image data. We discuss the influence of different SVM parameters in the context of an algorithm for cell segmentation and tracking. Finally, we describe how the application of SVMs has been critical to study protein localization in yeast screens, for lineage tracing in C. elegans, or to determine the developmental stage of Drosophila embryos to investigate gene expression dynamics. We propose that SVMs will become central tools in the analysis of the complex image data that novel microscopy modalities have made possible.

A database of material properties has been created using several particle radius and volume fraction. A second database built with antenna simulations has been developed to complete the machine learning dataset. It is shown that, starting from particle radius and volume fraction of the nano-magnetic material, it is possible to calculate the antenna parameters like gain, bandwidth, radiation efficiency, resonant frequency, and viceversa with good precision by using machine learning techniques.

AB Supervised hashing methods, which aim to generate semantic similarity-preserving binary codes, have been proposed to improve the performance of large-scale image retrieval. However, learning binary codes remains an NP-hard problem due to the binary constraints and complex computation. Existing hashing methods have never explored the potentiality of the label information, leading to a limited performance. To address these problems, we propose a simple supervised hashing method based on extreme learning machine (ELM). And we generate the supervised information in ELM by target code learning instead of using the traditional label code to fit the retrieval problem. With this modified label code, our method can produce high-quality binary codes and obtain high retrieval precision. Comprehensive experiments have shown our superiority to other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Modern computer and communication infrastructures are highly vulnerable to malicious codes and activities. There are many different ways malicious codes such as viruses, worms, Trojan horses etc. can damage a multitude of services, computers, financial structures, cyber infrastructure and data privacy. Signature based detection are more prevalent in preventing these types of attacks than machine learning detection. Anti-virus vendors are facing huge quantities (thousands) of suspicious files every day. These files are collected from various sources including dedicated honeypots, third party providers and files reported by customers either automatically or explicitly. The large number of files makes efficient and effective inspection of codes particularly challenging. In this paper, we propose a two part hybrid detection system that is in two parts. One part is a misuse detection system and the second part is an anomaly detection system. Misuse dependent detection is based on a random forest classifier and anomaly based detection is based on a single class SVM with bagging technique. We depart from the usual approach by using Correlation Feature Selection algorithm (CFS) for feature selection. Our experiment shows that our hybrid detection system outperforms the existing hybrid systems with other machine learning algorithms.

ID FACE RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK
AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) has been proposed for solving fast supervised learning problems by applying random computational nodes in the hidden layer. Similar to support vector machine, ELM cannot handle high-dimensional data effectively. Its generalization performance tends to become bad when it deals with high-dimensional data. In order to exploit high-dimensional data effectively, a two-stage extreme learning machine model is established. In the first stage, we incorporate ELM into the spectral regression algorithm to implement dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data and compute the output weights. In the second stage, the decision function of standard ELM model is computed based on the low-dimensional data and the obtained output weights. This is due to the fact that two stages are all based on ELM. Thus, output weights in the second stage can be approximately replaced by those in the first stage. Consequently, the proposed method can be applicable to high-dimensional data at a fast learning speed. Experimental results show that the proposed two-stage ELM scheme tends to have better scalability and achieves outstanding generalization performance at a faster learning speed than ELM.

ID EXPERTISE
AB We developed CHISSL, a human-machine interface that utilizes interactive supervision to help the user group unlabeled instances by her own mental model. The user primarily interacts via correction (moving a misplaced instance into its correct group) or confirmation (accepting that an instance is placed in its correct group). Concurrent with the user's interactions, CHISSL trains a classification model guided by the user's grouping of the data. It then predicts the group of unlabeled instances and arranges some of these alongside the instances manually organized by the user. We hypothesize that this mode of human and machine collaboration is more effective than Active Learning, wherein the machine decides for itself which instances should be labeled by the user. We found supporting evidence for this hypothesis in a pilot study where we applied CHISSL to organize a collection of handwritten digits.

AB In the last decades, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm has attracted more and more attention, and become the research focus in the field of machine learning. This paper leads the typical RL algorithm, Q-learning algorithm, into computer game platform (Connect6), and proposes an improved method. We adjust reward parameter according to the shape of Connect6, and optimize the adjustment of evaluation function to achieve the global optimization. Moreover, the optimization of the reward makes the valueless units away from the evaluation, to reduce the interference of valueless units for optimal results and improve the convergence speed, thereby reducing the overall time of self-learning process.

AB Dermatology is one of the fields where computer aided diagnostic is developing rapidly. The presented research concentrates on creation of automatic methods for melanoid skin lesions diagnosis using machine learning methods. In the experiments 1010 samples described in [5] are used. There are 275 melanoma cases and 735 benign ones. Three different machine learning methods are applied, namely the Naive Bayes classifier, the Random Forest, the K* instance-based classifier, and Attributional Calculus. The obtained results confirm that clinical history context and dermoscopic structures together with the selected machine learning methods may be an important and accurate diagnostic tool.

AB The emergence of new networking paradigms like Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things has introduced new security challenges that deserve new mechanisms to guarantee the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information and services to the users. One of the currently most studied strategies to satisfy these necessities is the use of hybrid Machine Learning techniques to automatize the process of intrusion detection in computer networks. This paper presents the design, implementation and performance analysis of multiple hybrid Machine Learning models for the task of intrusion detection in computer networks. Our results show that the combination of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms complement each other to the task of creating a model capable of adapting to the detection of known and unknown attacks.

AB The screening of novel materials with good performance and the modelling of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), among other issues, are hot topics in the field of materials science. Traditional experiments and computational modelling often consume tremendous time and resources and are limited by their experimental conditions and theoretical foundations. Thus, it is imperative to develop a new method of accelerating the discovery and design process for novel materials. Recently, materials discovery and design using machine learning have been receiving increasing attention and have achieved great improvements in both time efficiency and prediction accuracy. In this review, we first outline the typical mode of and basic procedures for applying machine learning in materials science, and we classify and compare the main algorithms. Then, the current research status is reviewed with regard to applications of machine learning in material property prediction, in new materials discovery and for other purposes. Finally, we discuss problems related to machine learning in materials science, propose possible solutions, and forecast potential directions of future research. By directly combining computational studies with experiments, we hope to provide insight into the parameters that affect the properties of materials, thereby enabling more efficient and target-oriented research on materials discovery and design.

AB This paper proposes an effective Multiple Matrix Learning Machine with Five Aspects of Pattern Information (MMFI). First aspect lies in the class label of each training or validation pattern. Second aspect is the values of components for each pattern. Third aspect is the relationship between patterns in the local regions of input space. Fourth aspect is the representation information and discriminant roles of different matrix representations for patterns. Fifth aspect is the information of patterns in each matrix representation learning. The innovations of the proposed MMFI are: (1) establishing a pattern-dependent function in the matrix learning so as to realize different roles of patterns for the first time; (2) adopting five aspects of pattern information so that a more feasible learning machine can be trained. The advantages of MMFI are: (1) proposing a new nonlinear learning machine which is different from the state-of-the-art kernelization one; (2) achieving a statistically superior classification performance than those learning machines without the introduction of five aspects of pattern information; (3) possessing a lower or comparable computational-complexity than other compared multiple matrix learning machines.

DE reliability engineering; machine learning; classification
AB In reliability engineering, the reliability of a system is estimated by considering the dependencies between the system's components. The probability of a system failure is then expressed in terms of the states of its components. Meanwhile, in some machine learning approaches, the probability of class membership is expressed in terms of the values (which can be seen as 'states') of various features (which can be seen as 'components'). In this paper, we explore this analogy further to develop a classification algorithm in which the decision for class membership is based on specific combinations of feature states, where those combinations are inspired by reliability engineering. In essence, our classification model considers the features to be components arranged in a parallel in a system, while different classes represent different system configurations. We describe the approach, present initial promising results, and speculate on further development of the approach.

AB Due to the complexity and extensive application of wireless systems, channel estimation has been a hot research issue, especially for high speed environments. High mobility challenges the speed of channel estimation and model optimization. Unlike conventional estimation implementations, this paper proposes a new channel estimation method based on extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. Simulation results of path loss estimation and channel type estimation show that the ability of ELM to provide extremely fast learning make it very suitable for estimating wireless channel for high speed environments. The results also show that channel estimation based on ELM can produce good generalization performance. Thus, ELM is an effective tool in channel estimation.

AB This article discusses the development of the online sequential circular extreme learning machine (OS-CELM) and structural tolerance OS-CELM (STOS-CELM). OS-CELM is developed based on the circular extreme learning machine (CELM) to enable sequential learning. It can update a new chunk of data by spending less training time to update the chunk than the batch CELM. STOS-CELM is developed based on an idea similar to that of OS-CELM, but with a Householder block exact inverse QR decomposition (QRD) recursive least squares (QRD-RLS) algorithm to allow sequential learning and mitigate the criticality of deciding the number of hidden nodes. In addition, our experiments have shown that given the same hidden node setting, STOS-CELM can deliver accuracy comparable to a batch CELM approach and also has higher accuracy than the original online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) and structural tolerance OS-ELM (STOS-ELM) in classification problems, especially those involving high dimension datasets.

DE Email; Information Extraction; Machine Learning; Ranking
AB Email is an essential communication medium for billions of people, with most users relying on web-based email services. Two recent trends are changing the email experience: smart phones have become the primary tool for accessing online services including email, and machine learning has come of age. Smartphones have a number of compelling properties (they are location-aware, usually with us, and allow us to record and share photos and videos), but they also have a few limitations, notably limited screen size and small and tedious virtual keyboards. Over the past few years, Google researchers and engineers have leveraged machine learning to ameliorate these weaknesses, and in the process created novel experiences. In this talk, I will give three examples of machine learning improving the email experience.
   The first example describes how we are improving email search. Displaying the most relevant results as the query is being typed is particularly useful on smartphones due to the aforementioned limitations. Combining hand-crafted and machine-learned rankers is powerful, but training learned rankers requires a relevance-labeled training set. User privacy prohibits us from employing raters to produce relevance labels. Instead, we leverage implicit feedback (namely clicks) provided by the users themselves. Using click logs as training data in a learning-to-rank setting is intriguing, since there is a vast and continuous supply of fresh training data. However, the click stream is biased towards queries that receive more clicks e.g. queries for which we already return the best result in the top-ranked position. I will summarize our work [2] on neutralizing that bias.
   The second example describes how we extract key information from appointment and reservation emails and surface it at the appropriate time as a reminder on the user's smartphone. Our basic approach [3] is to learn the templates that were used to generate these emails, use these templates to extract key information such as places, dates and times, store the extracted records in a personal information store, and surface them at the right time, taking contextual information such as estimated transit time into account.
   The third example describes Smart Reply [1], a system that offers a set of three short responses to those incoming emails for which a short response is appropriate, allowing users to respond quickly with just a few taps, without typing or involving voice-to-text transcription. The basic approach is to learn a model of likely short responses to original emails from the corpus, and then to apply the model whenever a new message arrives. Other considerations include offering a set of responses that are all appropriate and yet diverse, and triggering only when sufficiently confident that each responses is of high quality and appropriate.

AB Classification and quantitative characterization of neuronal morphologies from histological neuronal reconstruction is challenging since it is still unclear how to delineate a neuronal cell class and which are the best features to define them by. The morphological neuron characterization represents a primary source to address anatomical comparisons, morphometric analysis of cells, or brain modeling. The objectives of this paper are (i) to develop and integrate a pipeline that goes from morphological feature extraction to classification and (ii) to assess and compare the accuracy of machine learning algorithms to classify neuron morphologies. The algorithms were trained on 430 digitally reconstructed neurons subjectively classified into layers and/or m-types using young and/or adult development state population of the somatosensory cortex in rats. For supervised algorithms, linear discriminant analysis provided better classification results in comparison with others. For unsupervised algorithms, the affinity propagation and the Ward algorithms provided slightly better results.

AB Important brain parts like hippocampal usually being manually segmented by doctors. But with the introduction of hybrid between machine learning along with neuroimaging technique, it has proved to shows some promising results regarding on segmenting subcortical structures. However, it is known that Extreme Learning Machine ( ELM) is to be superior machine learning technique. This study will investigate on the usage of ELM to segment hippocampal by using various hidden nodes configuration. This study also will address on the usage of full image and region of interest (ROI) using ELM. Bag of features is used as a feature extractor where it will segment the hippocampal of the MRI in order to get its visual words. ELM will used it to learn its feature. Results shows that with suitable hidden nodes, it could achieve up to 100% performance on both cases for full image and ROI in hippocampal segmentation.

AB Multi-label classification learning provides a multi-dimensional perspective for polysemic object, and becomes a new research hotspot in machine learning in recent years. In the big data environment, it is urgent to obtain a fast and efficient multi-label classification algorithm. Kernel extreme learning machine was applied to multi-label classification problem (ML-KELM) in this paper, so the iterative learning operations can be avoided. Meanwhile, a dynamic, self-adaptive threshold function was designed to solve the transformation from ML-KELM network's real-value outputs to binary multi-label vector. ML-KELM has the least square optimal solution of ELM, and less parameters that needs adjustment, stable running, faster convergence speed and better generalization performance. Extensive multi-label classification experiments were conducted on data sets of different scale. Comparison results show that ML-KELM out performance in large scale dataset with high dimension instance feature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Vehicular Data includes different facts and measurements made over a set of moving vehicles. Most of us use cars or public transportation for our work commute, daily routines and leisure. But, except of our destination, possible time of arrival and what is directly around us, we know very little about the traffic conditions in the city as a whole. Because all roads are connected in a vast network, events in other parts of town can and will directly affect us. The more we know about the traffic inside a city, the better decisions we can make. Vehicular measurements may contain a vast amount of information about the way our cities function. Information that can be used for more than improving our commute, it is indicative of other features of the city like the amount of pollution in different regions. All the information and knowledge we can extract, can be used to directly improve our life.
   We live in a world where data is constantly generated and we store it and process it at an ever growing rate. Vehicular Data does not stray from this fact and is rapidly growing in size and complexity, with more and more ways to monitoring traffic, either from inside cars or from sensors placed on the road. Smartphones and in-car-computers are now common and they can produce a vast amount of data: it can identify a cars location, destination, current speed and even driving habits.
   Machine learning is the perfect complement for Big Data, as large data sets can be rendered useless without methods to extract knowledge and information from them. Machine learning, currently a popular research topic, has a large number of algorithms design to achieve this task, of knowledge extraction. Most of these techniques and algorithms can be directly applied to Vehicular Data.
   In this article we demonstrate how the use of a simple algorithm, k-Nearest Neighbors, can be used to extract valuable information from even a relatively small vehicular data set. Because of the vast size of most of our cities and the number of cars that are on their roads at any time of the day, standard machine learning systems do not manage to process data in a manner that would permit real time use of the extracted information. A solution to this problem is brought by distributed systems and cloud processing. By parallelizing and distributing machine learning algorithms we can use data at its highest potential and with little delay. Here, we show how this can be achieved by distributing the k-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm over MPI. We hope this would motivate the research into other combinations of merging machine learning algorithms with Vehicular Data sets.

AB Model building in machine learning is an iterative process. The performance analysis and debugging step typically involves a disruptive cognitive switch from model building to error analysis, discouraging an informed approach to model building. We present ModelTracker, an interactive visualization that subsumes information contained in numerous traditional summary statistics and graphs while displaying example-level performance and enabling direct error examination and debugging. Usage analysis from machine learning practitioners building real models with ModelTracker over six months shows ModelTracker is used often and throughout model building. A controlled experiment focusing on ModelTracker's debugging capabilities shows participants prefer ModelTracker over traditional tools without a loss in model performance.

AB Sentiment analysis is a methodology used to analyse the emotion or view of an individual to a situation or topic. In present scenario, Social media is the source for the collection of individual's feedbacks, user's emotions, reviews and personal experiences which lead to a need for efficient mining of the text to derive knowledge. An optimal classification of text based on emotion is an unsolved problem in text mining. To extract knowledge from text many machine learning tools and techniques were proposed An onto-based process is proposed to analyse the customer's emotion in this paper. The input emotional text that needs to be classified is given as input to the NLP and processed and an emotional ontology is created for better understanding of the semantics and relationships. When adding new instances, Ontology can be automatically classify them based on emotional relationship. The Emowords from ontology can be further classified using any of the standard machine learning techniques which definitively gives a better performance. This paper is a review of all the machine learning techniques that can be applied on the semantic analysis of sentiments.

AB Purpose of review
   Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a threat to global health and new approaches to combating AMR are needed. Use of machine learning in addressing AMR is in its infancy but has made promising steps. We reviewed the current literature on the use of machine learning for studying bacterial AMR.
   Recent findings
   The advent of large-scale data sets provided by next-generation sequencing and electronic health records make applying machine learning to the study and treatment of AMR possible. To date, it has been used for antimicrobial susceptibility genotype/phenotype prediction, development of AMR clinical decision rules, novel antimicrobial agent discovery and antimicrobial therapy optimization.
   Summary
   Application of machine learning to studying AMR is feasible but remains limited. Implementation of machine learning in clinical settings faces barriers to uptake with concerns regarding model interpretability and data quality.
   Future applications of machine learning to AMR are likely to be laboratory-based, such as antimicrobial susceptibility phenotype prediction.

AB A diamond adsorption detecting system based on machine learning is presented in this paper. The paper describes the system from the perspective of hardware and software design, and presents the image processing and machine learning algorithms applied in the system. The hardware includes three major parts-the camera, light source and support platform. The software includes modules of image acquisition, image preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning. This paper utilizes three supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and C4.5 decisions. Through the comparison study of the three algorithms, SVM is found to have the best performance for this system. It is demonstrated in experimental tests that the algorithm can obtain an accuracy of 97.84%, which improves the detection efficacy of the system significantly.

AB We study the problem of predicting Internet path changes and path performance using traceroute measurements and machine learning models. Path changes are frequently linked to path ination and performance degradation, therefore the relevance of the problem. We introduce NETPerfTrace, an Internet Path Tracking system to forecast path changes and path latency variations. By relying on decision trees and using empirical distribution-based input features, we show that NETPerfTrace can predict (i) the remaining life time of a path before it actually changes and (ii) the number of path changes in a certain time period with relatively high accuracy. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that NETPerfTrace highly outperforms DTRACK, a previous system with the same prediction targets. NETPerfTrace also offers path performance forecasting capabilities. In particular, our tool can predict path latency metrics, providing a system which can not only predict path changes, but also forecast their impact in terms of performance variations. We release NETPerfTrace as open software to the networking community, as well as all evaluation datasets.

ID MODEL
AB Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence concerned with techniques that allow computers to improve their outputs based on previous experiences. Among numerous machine learning algorithms, Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (WELM) is one of the famous cases recently. It not only has Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)'s extremely fast training speed and better generalization performance than traditional Neuron Network (NN), but also has the merit in handling imbalance data by assigning more weight to minority class and less weight to majority class. But it still has the limitation of its weight generated according to class distribution of training data, thereby, creating dependency on input data [R. Sharma and A. S. Bist, Genetic algorithm based weighted extreme learning machine for binary imbalance learning, 2015 Int. Conf. Cognitive Computing and Information Processing (CCIP) (IEEE, 2015), pp. 1-6; N. Koutsouleris, Classification/machine learning approaches, Annu. Rev. Clin. Psychol. 13(1) (2016); G. Dudek, Extreme learning machine for function approximation-interval problem of input weights and biases, 2015 IEEE 2nd Int. Conf. Cybernetics (CYBCONF) (IEEE, 2015), pp. 62-67; N. Zhang, Y. Qu and A. Deng, Evolutionary extreme learning machine based weighted nearest-neighbor equality classification, 2015 7th Int. Conf. Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC), Vol. 2 (IEEE, 2015), pp. 274-279]. This leads to the lack offinding optimal weight at which good generalization performance could be achieved [R. Sharma and A. S. Bist, Genetic algorithm based weighted extreme learning machine for binary imbalance learning, 2015 Int. Conf. Cognitive Computing and Information Processing (CCIP) (IEEE, 2015), pp. 1-6; N. Koutsouleris, Classification/machine learning approaches, Annu. Rev. Clin. Psychol. 13(1) (2016); G. Dudek, Extreme learning machine for function approximation-interval problem of input weights and biases, 2015 IEEE 2nd Int. Conf. Cybernetics (CYBCONF) (IEEE, 2015), pp. 62- 67; N. Zhang, Y. Qu and A. Deng, Evolutionary extreme learning machine based weighted nearest- neighbor equality classification, 2015 7th Int. Conf. Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC), Vol. 2 (IEEE, 2015), pp. 274-279]. To solve it, a hybrid algorithm which composed by WELM algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed. Firstly, it distributes the weight according to the number of different samples, determines weighted method; Then, it combines the ELM model and the weighted method to establish WELM model; finally it utilizes PSO to optimize WELM's three parameters (input weight, bias, the weight of imbalanced training data). Experiment data from both prediction and recognition show that it has better performance than classical WELM algorithms.

AB This paper mainly analyses the forecasting of sub-sovereign credit ratings using machine learning methods in the non-US, Europe and other regional and sub-sovereign ratings. Specific focus is based on developing an accurate forecasting model based on machine learning. We examine its forecasting accuracy on two forecasting horizons, one and two years ahead. The study was designed to determine the cost sensitivity of various machine learning methods and to develop an accurate decision-support system that minimize the cost of credit rating classification for sub-sovereign entities across countries and world regions. We looked at each side of the economic, financial and debt and budget, revenues and expenditures, to provide sufficient inputs for the machine learning models. The analyses is to consider the ordinal character of the rating classes, classification cost (cost-sensitive) which is used as objective function, in assessing credit ratings and evaluating of bonds i.e. regional credit rating modelling.

AB Discriminative subgraph mining from a large collection of graph objects is a crucial problem for graph classification. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a simple and efficient Single-hidden Layer Feedforward neural Networks (SLFNs) algorithm with extremely fast learning capacity. In this paper, we propose a discriminative subgraph mining approach based on ELM-Filter strategy within the scalable MapReduce computing model. We randomly partition the collection of graphs among worker nodes, and each worker applies a fast pattern evolutionary method to mine a set of discriminative subgraphs with the help of ELM-Filter strategy in its partition. And, the set of discriminative subgraphs must produce higher ELM training accuracy. The union of all such discriminative subgraphs is the mining result for the input large-scale graphs. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets show that our method obviously outperforms the other approaches in terms of both classification accuracy and runtime efficiency.

   Event Patterns
AB Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a novel and promising methodology that enables the real-time analysis of stream event data. The main purpose of CEP is detection of the complex event patterns from the atomic and semantically low-level events such as sensor, log, or RFID data. Determination of the rule patterns for matching these simple events based on the temporal, semantic, or spatial correlations is the central task of CEP systems. In the current design of the CEP systems, experts provide event rule patterns. Having reached maturity, the Big Data Systems and Internet of Things (IoT) technology require the implementation of advanced machine learning approaches for automation in the CEP domain. The goal of this research is proposing a machine learning model to replace the manual identification of rule patterns. After a pre-processing stage (dealing with missing values, data outliers, etc.), various rule-based machine learning approaches were applied to detect complex events. Promising results with high preciseness were obtained. A comparative analysis of the performance of classifiers is discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Matrix learning, multiple-view learning, Universum learning, and local learning are four hot spots of present research. Matrix learning aims to design feasible machines to process matrix patterns directly. Multiple-view learning takes pattern information from multiple aspects, i.e., multiple-view information into account. Universum learning can reflect priori knowledge about application domain and improve classification performances. A good local learning approach is important to the finding of local structures and pattern information. Our previous proposed learning machine, double-fold localized multiple matrix learning machine is a one with multiple-view information, local structures, and matrix learning. But this machine does not take Universum learning into account. Thus, this paper proposes a double-fold localized multiple matrix learning machine with Universum (Uni-DLMMLM) so as to improve the performance of a learning machine. Experimental results have validated that Uni-DLMMLM (1) makes full use of the domain knowledge of whole data distribution as well as inherits the advantages of matrix learning; (2) combines Universum learning with matrix learning so as to capture more global knowledge; (3) has a good ability to process different kinds of data sets; (4) has a superior classification performance and leads to a low empirical generation risk bound.

AB Machine learning is being used in a wide range of application domains to discover patterns in large datasets. Increasingly, the results of machine learning drive critical decisions in applications related to healthcare and biomedicine. Such health-related applications are often sensitive, and thus, any security breach would be catastrophic. Naturally, the integrity of the results computed by machine learning is of great importance. Recent research has shown that some machine-learning algorithms can be compromised by augmenting their training datasets with malicious data, leading to a new class of attacks called poisoning attacks. Hindrance of a diagnosis may have life-threatening consequences and could cause distrust. On the other hand, not only may a false diagnosis prompt users to distrust the machine-learning algorithm and even abandon the entire system but also such a false positive classification may cause patient distress. In this paper, we present a systematic, algorithm-independent approach for mounting poisoning attacks across a wide range of machine-learning algorithms and healthcare datasets. The proposed attack procedure generates input data, which, when added to the training set, can either cause the results of machine learning to have targeted errors (e.g., increase the likelihood of classification into a specific class), or simply introduce arbitrary errors ( incorrect classification). These attacks may be applied to both fixed and evolving datasets. They can be applied even when only statistics of the training dataset are available or, in some cases, even without access to the training dataset, although at a lower efficacy. We establish the effectiveness of the proposed attacks using a suite of six machine-learning algorithms and five healthcare datasets. Finally, we present countermeasures against the proposed generic attacks that are based on tracking and detecting deviations in various accuracy metrics, and benchmark their effectiveness.

AB Machine learning is a very powerful domain in the field of computer science. However, a lot of time is consumed in execution and learning from the humongous datasets. In the last decade General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) have revolutionized the computing industry by their capability to process data in parallel and hence speedup the entire process. This paper aims to showcase a generic model which can be used as a reference to convert implementations of serial machine learning algorithms to parallel implementations. Because of varying types of machine learning algorithms, the model was developed with a broad mindset to support most of them. After development, for the purpose of testing the correctness of the model, a few machine learning algorithms of different kinds are experimented with. They were processed step-by-step in accordance with the model and their original serial implementations in C and the resultant parallel implementations in CUDA were compared w.r.t. the computation time. Also, the serial implementations and parallel implementations were mapped to check if they gave the exact same results i.e. whether perfectly correct parallelism was obtained. The results obtained showed that the model when used for parallelization, gave absolutely correct parallel implementations, without any losses due to parallelization. The model gave highly efficient outcomes for non-neural network based supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms with a speedup of 146x achieved in K-NN algorithm and 75x achieved in K-Means algorithm. The model also gave a correct parallel implementation for Backpropagation algorithm, however here the parallel implementation could not execute faster than the serial implementation.

AB Machine learning is a method in which computers are given the competence to acquire without being unambiguously programmed. Machine learning discovers the learning and structuring of algorithms that can learn from the past data and make predictions on the same. Methods for relating two or more algorithms on a single dataset have been inspected in the current scenario, comparison of algorithms on multiple datasets is even more crucial for a typical machine learning studies. In this paper I have discussed about the Kappa and Accuracy Evaluations of Machine Learning Classifiers on multiple datasets. The objective of this paper is to compare and analyze the execution of these algorithms based on the efficiency of machine learning algorithms such as Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest.

TI Machine learning strategies for systems with invariance properties

ID NEURAL-NETWORK; CONSTITUTIVE MODEL; HYPERELASTIC MATERIAL
AB In many scientific fields, empirical models are employed to facilitate computational simulations of engineering systems. For example, in fluid mechanics, empirical Reynolds stress closures enable computationally-efficient Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Likewise, in solid mechanics, constitutive relations between the stress and strain in a material are required in deformation analysis. Traditional methods for developing and tuning empirical models usually combine physical intuition with simple regression techniques on limited data sets. The rise of high performance computing has led to a growing availability of high fidelity simulation data. These data open up the possibility of using machine learning algorithms, such as random forests or neural networks, to develop more accurate and general empirical models. A key question when using data-driven algorithms to develop these empirical models is how domain knowledge should be incorporated into the machine learning process. This paper will specifically address physical systems that possess symmetry or invariance properties. Two different methods for teaching a machine learning model an invariance property are compared. In the first method, a basis of invariant inputs is constructed, and the machine learning model is trained upon this basis, thereby embedding the invariance into the model. In the second method, the algorithm is trained on multiple transformations of the raw input data until the model learns invariance to that transformation. Results are discussed for two case studies: one in turbulence modeling and one in crystal elasticity. It is shown that in both cases embedding the invariance property into the input features yields higher performance at significantly reduced computational training costs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

DE Machine Learning; Down Syndrome
AB Down Syndrome is a chromosomal disease which causes many physical and cognitive disabilities. Down Syndrome patients are more vulnerable than any other patient. Medical experts started knowing it now with keen awareness. In recent years it has become a field of interest for many researchers, medical experts and social organisation. For the researchers it is an area of interest where very little work is done and a lot to he explored. Machine Learning consists of different processing levels like pre-processing, segmentation, feature selection and classification. Each level contains a vast set of techniques like filters, segmentation algorithms and classifiers. Machine Learning is one of the most popular algorithm, which is used to automate the decision making process with higher rate of accuracy in less time with least error rate. Machine Learning proved its significance with highest rate of accuracy in decision making and problem solving in almost all the fields but automated decision making in medical science is still a challenge. This paper reviews the different works done in the field of Down Syndrome using Machine Learning applied on different medical images, and the techniques like pre-processing, segmentation, feature selection and classification. The aim of this research work is to analyse and identify the Machine Learning methodologies that works efficiently to detect Down Sundrome.

AB Correctly identifying an emotion has always been challenging for humans, not to mention machines! In this research, we use machine learning to classify human emotion. Emotional differences between genders are well documented in fields like psychology. We hypothesize that genders will impact the accuracy of classifying emotion with machine learning. Two different machine learning approaches were tested in an experimental study. In one approach, emotions from both genders were used to train the machine. In another approach, the genders were separated and two separate machines were used to learn the emotions of the two genders. Our preliminary results show that the approach where the genders were separated produces higher accuracy in classifying emotion.

The new approach not only improves the speed of basic ELM algorithm that contains many hidden nodes, but also overcomes the weakness of basic ELM of low learning efficiency and generalization ability by getting rid of redundant information in the observed values. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and can produce desirable generalization performance in most cases based on a few regression and classification problem.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM), as a new learning framework, draws increasing attractions in the areas of large-scale computing, high-speed signal processing, artificial intelligence, and so on. ELM aims to break the barriers between the conventional artificial learning techniques and biological learning mechanism and represents a suite of machine learning techniques in which hidden neurons need not to be tuned. ELM theories and algorithms argue that "random hidden neurons" capture the essence of some brain learning mechanisms as well as the intuitive sense that the efficiency of brain learning need not rely on computing power of neurons. Thus, compared with traditional neural networks and support vector machine, ELM offers significant advantages such as fast learning speed, ease of implementation, and minimal human intervention. Due to its remarkable generalization performance and implementation efficiency, ELM has been applied in various applications. In this paper, we first provide an overview of newly derived ELM theories and approaches. On the other hand, with the ongoing development of multilayer feature representation, some new trends on ELM-based hierarchical learning are discussed. Moreover, we also present several interesting ELM applications to showcase the practical advances on this subject.

ID STRATEGY
AB Task-based programming models adopt different scheduling strategies to exploit parallelism in irregular applications. These scheduling strategies differ in terms of exploiting data locality, maintaining load balance, and minimizing overhead. OpenMP tasks allow programmers to express unstructured parallelism at a high level of abstraction and make the runtime responsible about the burden of scheduling parallel execution. For irregular applications, the performance of task scheduling cannot often be predicted due to the nature of application, the used compiler, and the platform/architecture dependencies. In this work, we introduce an automatic, portable, and adaptive runtime feedback-driven framework (APARF) that combines standard low-level tasking runtime APIs, a developed profiling tool, and a hybrid machine learning model. We employ APARF to select the optimum task scheduling scheme of any given application using similarity analysis through the correlation between the captured runtime APIs with low profiling costs. Our hybrid model predicts the best scheduling strategy for a variety of unseen applications with an average accuracy of 93%, while maintaining a 100% training accuracy. An average performance enhancement of 25% was obtained compared with the default configuration, when APARF was applied on different unseen programs. APARF was examined against a real application (Molecular Dynamics), where we achieved up to 31% performance improvement. Compared to Intel, PGI and GNU compilers, our predicted scheme achieved better performance in most cases.

AB In this paper machine learning and human learning are applied jointly to optimize the training of linear regression. Human learning is exploited to label extra training data so as to resolve problems such as insufficient training and over-fitting. Considering the inevitable human errors in labeling, two machine learning algorithms are developed which optimize the selection of the extra training data and detect human errors during linear regression. The first algorithm assumes sparse human errors and implements a sparse optimization within a sequential active learning procedure. The second algorithm deals with non-sparse human errors. By exploiting the IRT (item response theory) to model the distribution of human errors, it reconstructs the training data set so that the human labeling errors become sparse. Simulations are conducted to show that the two algorithms are effective in resolving the insufficient training and human labeling error problems.

ID CLASSIFICATION; APPROXIMATION; NETWORKS
AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) was recently proposed as a unifying framework for different families of learning algorithms. The classical ELM model consists of a linear combination of a fixed number of nonlinear expansions of the input vector. Learning in ELM is hence equivalent to finding the optimal weights that minimize the error on a dataset. The update works in batch mode, either with explicit feature mappings or with implicit mappings defined by kernels. Although an online version has been proposed for the former, no work has been done up to this point for the latter, and whether an efficient learning algorithm for online kernel-based ELM exists remains an open problem. By explicating some connections between nonlinear adaptive filtering and ELM theory, in this brief, we present an algorithm for this task. In particular, we propose a straightforward extension of the well-known kernel recursive least-squares, belonging to the kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) family, to the ELM framework. We call the resulting algorithm the kernel online sequential ELM (KOS-ELM). Moreover, we consider two different criteria used in the KAF field to obtain sparse filters and extend them to our context. We show that KOS-ELM, with their integration, can result in a highly efficient algorithm, both in terms of obtained generalization error and training time. Empirical evaluations demonstrate interesting results on some benchmarking datasets.

ID DESCRIPTORS
AB In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for video based action recognition referred to as dual-layer kernel extreme learning machine (DKELM). Our approach takes advantages of both early and late fusion techniques into a unified framework. In particular, the first layer in DKELM adopts linear kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) on handcrafted feature kernel, deep-learned feature kernel, and the fused kernel to provide various perspectives about the video. The second layer trains a radial basis function based KELM classifier on different fusion scores obtained from the first layer to predict the final action class label. Finally, we empirically show the superior performance of DKELM, both in terms of accuracy and computational time, over some state-of-the-art human action recognition methods on two large-scale datasets.

AB Applying feed-forward neural networks has been limited due to the use of conventional gradient-based slow learning algorithms in training and iterative determination of network parameters. This paper demonstrates a method that partly overcomes these problems by using an extreme learning machine (ELM) which predicts the hydrological time-series very quickly. ELMs, also called single-hidden layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs), are able to well generalize the performance for extremely complex problems. ELM randomly chooses a single hidden layer and analytically determines the weights to predict the output. The ELM method was applied to predict hydrological flow series for the Tryggevealde Catchment, Denmark and for the Mississippi River at Vicksburg, USA. The results confirmed that ELM's performance was similar or better in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) compared to ANN and other previously published techniques, namely evolutionary computation based support vector machine (EC-SVM), standard chaotic approach and inverse approach.

AB When we identify the thermal systems with traditional machine learning algorithms, slow learning speed and easily falling into local minimum phenomenon may often appear due to the nonlinearity and uncertainty of thermal systems. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an identification method based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which has the features of simple parameter settings, and without iterative optimization. The simulation results show that in thermal process identification, ELM has a decided advantage in both identification speed and identification accuracy.

AB The application of machine learning models to the analysis of network measurement problems has largely increased in the last decade; however, there is still no clear best-practice or silver bullet approach to address these problems in a general context, and only adhoc and tailored approaches have been evaluated so far. While deep-learning models have provided a major breakthrough in highly-dimensional problems such as image processing, it is difficult to say today which is the best model to address the analysis of large volumes of highlydimensional data collected in operational networks. In this paper we present a potential solution to fill this gap, exploring the application of ensemble learning models to multiple network measurement problems. We introduce GML Learning, a generic Machine Learning model for the analysis of network measurements. The GML model is a generalization of the well-known stacking approach to ensemble learning, and follows the concepts of the Super Learner model. The Super Learner performs asymptotically as well as the best input base or weak learners, providing a very powerful approach to tackle multiple problems with the same technique. In addition, it defines an approach to minimize over-fitting likelihood during training, using a variant of cross-validation. We deploy the GML model on top of BigDAMA, a big data analytics framework for network measurement applications. We test the proposed solution in five different and assorted network measurement problems, including detection of network attacks and anomalies, QoE modeling and prediction, and Internet-paths dynamics tracking. Results confirm that the GML model provides better results than any of the single baseline models of the stack, and outperforms traditional bagging and boosting ensemble learning approaches. The GML Learning model opens the door for a generalization of a best-practice technique for the analysis of network measurements.

AB Time series predicting has become an important issue in many fields. The prediction methods which are based on the extreme learning machines have attracted many researchers. However, the predicted results of the extreme learning machines have some randomness. To obtain the better predicting performance and improve the randomness, we pro pose a new adaptive ensemble model of extreme learning machines (Ada-ELM) in this paper, which can adjust the ensemble weights automatically. We test Ada-ELM on two actual time series comparing with other four prediction methods based on the extreme learning machines. In the experiments, Ada-ELM outperform the other four methods and shows the good adaptability of our prediction method to different time series.

We applied word2vec to construct word vectors, which were then used to vectorize tweet blocks. The resulting tweet vectors were used as inputs for training models, and the prediction accuracy of those models was examined as a function of the dimension of the tweet vectors and the size of the tweet blocks. The results showed that the machine learning algorithms could predict the three personal attributes of interest with 60-70% accuracy.

The semantic relation tags namely Cure, Prevent and Sideeffects helps to find out the relationship between disease and treatment. Many methodologies like co-occurrence analysis, rule based methodologies and statistical methods are used in disease treatment relation. However, machine learning is widely used in many applications like protein-protein interaction, extraction of medical knowledge and in health care field. we propose a machine learning approach termed as SMO classification, which uses several features namely medical papers, medical abstracts. Our approach identifies the features namely disease-treat, cure, prevent and sideeffects. The performance can be measured by Accuracy, Precision, F-measure and Recall.

AB Indoor localization has gained much attention over several decades due to enormous applications. However, the accuracy of indoor localization is hard to improve because the signal propagation has small scale effects which leads to inaccurate measurements. In this paper, we propose an efficient learning approach that combines grid search based kernel support vector machine and principle component analysis. The proposed approach applies principle component analysis to reduce high dimensional measurements. Then we design a grid search algorithm to optimize the parameters of kernel support vector machine in order to improve the localization accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach reduces the localization error and improves the computational efficiency comparing with K-nearest neighbor, Back Propagation Neural Network and Support Vector Machine based methods.

AB In this paper, we propose a fast manifold learning strategy to estimate the underlying geometrical distribution and develop the relevant mathematical criterion on the basis of the extreme learning machine (ELM) in the high-dimensional space. The local tangent space alignment (LTSA) method has been used to perform the manifold production and the single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) is established via ELM to simulate the low-dimensional representation process. The scheme of the ELM ensemble then combines the individual SLFN for the model selection, where the manifold regularization mechanism has been brought into ELM to preserve the local geometrical structure of LTSA. Some developments have been done to evaluate the inherent representation embedding in the ELM learning. The simulation results have shown the excellent performance in the accuracy and efficiency of the developed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We explore how existing theories of interaction design and machine learning apply to the psychotherapy context, and identify "contestability" as a new principle for designing systems that evaluate human behavior. Finally, we offer several strategies for making ML systems more accountable to human actors.

AB Surgery cancellation has a greatly negative impact on both hospital and patient. A commonly used method for improving this problem is analyzing cancellation reasons through statistical analysis, while the improvement is inefficient. Based on surgery data from the hospital information system (HIS) of West China Hospital (WCH), we proposed to use machine learning methods include Random forests (RF), Bagging, Boosting and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to predict surgery cancellation. The experimental result shows that the Boosting with Over-sampling performed well in prediction accuracy (Sensitive: 0.5234, Specific: 0.8105, Accuracy: 0.7651 and AUC: 0.6670). And our research also points out the latent causes for surgery cancellation. It's useful for hospital managers.

AB Discrete Event System Specification DEVS separates modeling and simulation execution. Simulation execution is done within a runtime environment that is often called a DEVS simulator. This separation creates an opportunity to incorporate smart algorithms in the simulator to optimize simulation execution. In this paper, we propose incorporating some predictive machine learning algorithms into the DEVS simulator that can cut simulation execution times significantly for many simulation applications without compromising the simulation accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a specific learning mechanism that can be embedded into the DEVS simulator to incrementally build a predictive model that learns from past simulations. We further look into issues related to the predictive model selection, its prediction accuracy, its effect on the overall simulation performance, and when to switch between the predictive model and the simulation during an execution.

AB Background: Software fault prediction is the process of developing models that can be used by the software practitioners in the early phases of software development life cycle for detecting faulty constructs such as modules or classes. There are various machine learning techniques used in the past for predicting faults. Method: In this study we perform a systematic review of studies from January 1991 to October 2013 in the literature that use the machine learning techniques for software fault prediction. We assess the performance capability of the machine learning techniques in existing research for software fault prediction. We also compare the performance of the machine learning techniques with the statistical techniques and other machine learning techniques. Further the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning techniques are summarized.
   Results: In this paper we have identified 64 primary studies and seven categories of the machine learning techniques. The results prove the prediction capability of the machine learning techniques for classifying module/class as fault prone or not fault prone. The models using the machine learning techniques for estimating software fault proneness outperform the traditional statistical models.
   Conclusion: Based on the results obtained from the systematic review, we conclude that the machine learning techniques have the ability for predicting software fault proneness and can be used by software practitioners and researchers. However, the application of the machine learning techniques in software fault prediction is still limited and more number of studies should be carried out in order to obtain well formed and generalizable results. We provide future guidelines to practitioners and researchers based on the results obtained in this work. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One Class Classification (OCC) has been prime concern for researchers and effectively employed in various disciplines for outlier or novelty detection. But, traditional methods based one class classifier is very time consuming due to its iterative process for various parameters tuning. This paper presents four novel different OCC methods with their ten variants based on extreme Learning Machine (ELM). As we know, threshold decision is a crucial factor in case of OCC, so, three different threshold declining criteria have been employed so far. Our proposed classifiers mainly lie in two categories i.e. out of four proposed one class classifiers, two classifiers belong to reconstruction based and two belong to boundary based. In four proposed methods, two methods perform random feature mapping and two methods perform kernel feature mapping. These methods are tested on three benchmark datasets and exhibit better performance compared to eleven traditional one class classifiers.

AB In this paper, we propose a user customized service provider framework based on machine learning. The framework consists of mobile stations, data collector, analysis tools and service applications. As an analysis tool, we deploy machine learning techniques, in particular, support vector machine which generates learning model and precise classifiers. Moreover, K-fold cross-validation is used to achieve better accurate inference from the collected data. Then, we develop a predictor that predicts users' behavior patterns from the information of time connections and APs. This enables to provide adaptive services customized for end-users, e.g., smart phone push notifications services.

ID OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES; RISK; MEN; FIT; BMD
AB Apply machine learning principles to predict hip fractures and estimate predictor importance in Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-scanned men and women. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry data from two Danish regions between 1996 and 2006 were combined with national Danish patient data to comprise 4722 women and 717 men with 5 years of follow-up time (original cohort n = 6606 men and women). Twenty-four statistical models were built on 75% of data points through k-5, 5-repeat cross-validation, and then validated on the remaining 25% of data points to calculate area under the curve (AUC) and calibrate probability estimates. The best models were retrained with restricted predictor subsets to estimate the best subsets. For women, bootstrap aggregated flexible discriminant analysis ("bagFDA") performed best with a test AUC of 0.92 [0.89; 0.94] and well-calibrated probabilities following Na < ve Bayes adjustments. A "bagFDA" model limited to 11 predictors (among them bone mineral densities (BMD), biochemical glucose measurements, general practitioner and dentist use) achieved a test AUC of 0.91 [0.88; 0.93]. For men, eXtreme Gradient Boosting ("xgbTree") performed best with a test AUC of 0.89 [0.82; 0.95], but with poor calibration in higher probabilities. A ten predictor subset (BMD, biochemical cholesterol and liver function tests, penicillin use and osteoarthritis diagnoses) achieved a test AUC of 0.86 [0.78; 0.94] using an "xgbTree" model. Machine learning can improve hip fracture prediction beyond logistic regression using ensemble models. Compiling data from international cohorts of longer follow-up and performing similar machine learning procedures has the potential to further improve discrimination and calibration.

AB Recent advances in machine learning with big data sets has allowed for significant advances in the optimisation of classification and recognition systems. However, for applications such as situational awareness systems, the entirety of the available data dwarfs the amount permissible for a training set with tractable machine learning optimization times. Furthermore, the performance of any optimized system is highly dependent of the training set correctly and completely representing the entire data space of scenarios. In this paper we present a technique to characterize the entire data space to ascertain the key factors for representation and subsequently select a subset that statistically represents the correct mix of scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these characterization and subset selection techniques by using a genetic algorithm to optimize the performance of a gunfire recognition system.

ID MISSING DATA; CHALLENGES; ACCURACY; ICD-9-CM
AB From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operated under a paper-based paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare into the digital age. Ranging from electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory reports, to public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration. Unfortunately, the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the ability to execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on which the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant effort has been undertaken to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized patient records, it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data. In fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare data presents an incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted for throughout the machine learning pipeline. This chapter focuses on highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes of the data accounted for during preprocessing, then move to considerations during model building, and end with challenges to the interpretation of model output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as it relates to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose on the efficiency of machine learning techniques.

AB SSH Attacks are of various types: SSH port scanning, SSH Brute-force attacks, Attacks using compromised SSH server. Attacks using a compromised server could be DoS attacks, Phishing attacks, E-mail spamming and so on. This paper questions whether the attacks from a compromised SSH server be segregated from other attacks using the network flows. In this work, we categorize SSH attacks into two types. The first category consists of all attack activities after a successful compromise of an SSH server. We name it as "severe" attacks. The second type includes all attacks leading to a successful compromise. It consists of SSH port scanning, SSH Brute-force attack, and compromised SSH server with no activities. The second category is named as "not-so-severe" attacks. We employ Machine Learning algorithms, namely, Naive Bayes learner, Logistic Regression, J48 decision tree, and Support Vector Machine to classify these attacks. Suitable features were selected based on domain knowledge, literature survey, and feature selection technique to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms using the metrics accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F-score.

AB Multi-label learning aims to predict the label sets an instance belongs to. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), as a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network algorithm, has been extended to multi-label scenarios because of faster learning speed and less human intervention. Aiming at dealing with the problem of ignoring the inter-label dependencies, the proposed method, ELM-LMF, decomposes the label matrix into latent label matrix mapping the label space to the latent space and the k-label dependency matrix preserving the inter-label relationships, classifies in latent space with ELM, and maps the predicted labels back to the original space. Experiments on 3 benchmark multi-label data sets with 3 other state-of-art methods prove the feasibility of ELM-LMF.

AB Based on Gaussian margin machine (GMM) and extreme learning machine (ELM), confidence-weighted ELM (CW-ELM) is proposed to provide point forecasts and confidence intervals. CW-ELM maintains a multivariate normal distribution over the output weight vector. It is applied to seek the least informative distribution from those that keep the targets within the forecast confidence intervals. For simplicity, the covariance matrix is assumed to be diagonal. The simplified problem of CW-ELM is approximately solved by using Leave-One-Out-Incremental ELM (LOO-IELM) and the interior point method. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world regression datasets demonstrate that CW-ELM has better performance than Bayesian ELM and Gaussian process regression. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The existing degeneration strategy-based methods often suffer from some common drawbacks: (1) the user-specific parameter for the number of clusters may incur the effective problem; (2) SVM may bring a high computational cost when utilized as the classifier builder. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, namely multi-instance multi-label (MIML)-extreme learning machine (ELM), to address the problems. To our best knowledge, we are the first to utilize ELM in the MIML problem and to conduct the comparison of ELM and SVM on MIML. Extensive experiments have been conducted on real datasets and synthetic datasets. The results show that MIMLELM tends to achieve better generalization performance at a higher learning speed.

AB The lack of regulations and disclosures regarding intangible capital has made it rather difficult for investors and creditors to evaluate a firm's intangible value before making the associated investment and loan decisions. This study represents an initial attempt to compare/contrast different types of machine learning techniques and identify the optimal prediction model for intangible assets. In addition, this paper shows that machine learning can be used effectively for the problem of intangible assets evaluation. To be specific, five classification algorithms are considered: decision trees (DT), artificial neural networks (ANN), naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Consequently, thirty prediction models are constructed for comparison, including five single classifiers, boosting and bagging based classifier ensembles, and the combination of k-means clustering, single classifiers and classifier ensembles. The experimental results show that prediction models combining k-means with boosting/bagging based classifier ensembles perform much better than the other methods in terms of prediction accuracy, ROC Curve, as well as Type land II errors. In particular, while the best single classifier, k-NN provides 78.24% prediction accuracy, k-means + bagging based DT ensembles provide the best performance to predict intangible assets with a prediction accuracy of 91.60%, 96.40% of ROC Curve and 18.65% of Type land 634% of II errors, respectively.

AB Machine learning and text analytics have proven increasingly useful in a number of health-related applications, particularly in the context of analyzing online data for disease epidemics and warning signs of a variety of mental health issues. We follow in this tradition here, but focus our attention on cognitive distortion, a precursor and symptom of disruptive psychological disorders such as anxiety, anorexia and depression. We collected a number of personal blogs from the Tumblr API, and labeled them based on whether they exhibited distorted thought patterns. We then used LIWC to extract textual features and applied machine learning to the resulting vectors. Our findings show that it is possible to detect cognitive distortions automatically from personal blogs with relatively good accuracy (73.0%) and false negative rate (30.4%).

AB Data streams with class imbalance occur usually in many real applications. Online sequential learning is one of the effective methods for classifying data stream with class imbalance. This paper proposes a dual-weighted online sequential extreme learning machine (dw-ELM) method to solve it. On the basis of online sequential extreme learning machine, the proposed dw-ELM method analyzes the distribution characteristic of data in view of time and space, and gives an adaptive dual weighting scheme to tune the weights at both the time level and the space level. Extensive experimental evaluations on 10 imbalanced datasets indicate that the proposed dw-ELM method outperforms several comparing methods in terms of G-mean and F-measure metrics. Moreover, the proposed dw-ELM method remains superior classification performance in the presence of highly dynamic class imbalance.

AB This paper investigates how we might rethink design as the technological crafting of human-machine relations in the context of a machine learning technique called neural networks. It analyzes Google's Inceptionism project, which uses neural networks for image recognition. The surprising output of one the experiments reveals that such networks might be used to trace relations between entities. This paper contributes by fleshing out the necessary changes in the ways HCI builds, tests, and engages neural networks in the design of interactive systems from a relational perspective; it proposes a hybrid approach where machine learning algorithms are used to identify objects as well as connections between them; finally, it argues for remaining open to ontological surprises in machine learning as they may enable the crafting of different relations with and through technologies.

AB Hyperspectral imaging (HSI), also called imaging spectrometer, originated from remote sensing. Hyperspectral imaging is an emerging imaging modality for medical applications, especially in disease diagnosis and image-guided surgery. HSI acquires a three-dimensional dataset called hypercube, with two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension. Spatially resolved spectral imaging obtained by HSI provides diagnostic information about the objects physiology, morphology, and composition. The present work involves testing and evaluating the performance of the hyperspectral imaging system. The methodology involved manually taking reflectance of the object in many images or scan of the object. The object used for the evaluation of the system was cabbage and tomato. The data is further converted to the required format and the analysis is done using machine learning algorithm. The machine learning algorithms applied were able to distinguish between the object present in the hypercube obtain by the scan.
   It was concluded from the results that system was working as expected. This was observed by the different spectra obtained by using the machine-learning algorithm.

AB The extreme learning machine (ELM), a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network algorithm, was tested on nine environmental regression problems. The prediction accuracy and computational speed of the ensemble ELM were evaluated against multiple linear regression (MLR) and three nonlinear machine learning (ML) techniques - artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression and random forest (RF). Simple automated algorithms were used to estimate the parameters (e.g. number of hidden neurons) needed for model training. Scaling the range of the random weights in ELM improved its performance. Excluding large datasets (with large number of cases and predictors), ELM tended to be the fastest among the nonlinear models. For large datasets, RF tended to be the fastest. ANN and ELM had similar skills, but ELM was much faster than ANN except for large datasets. Generally, the tested ML techniques outperformed MLR, but no single method was best for all the nine datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machine learning is the process which converts the information into intelligent actions. This paper presents a literature review on application of different Machine Learning algorithms on huge amount of data collected by the academic institutes. Predictive analytics using the machine learning algorithms has become a new tool of this modern era, as it assists academic institutions in improving the retention and success rate of students and to get overview of performance before the examination to reduce the risk of failure. The main aim of the paper is to describe the various ways in which the machine learning is used in educational institutes and how institutes can get prediction of students' performance and the important features that are needed to be considered while making prediction for different things. In addition to this the study also compares the prediction given by different machine learning algorithms. Lastly the paper concludes that the prediction of the students' performance can be made more precise and accurate by considering the learning style of students, their motivation and interest, concentration level, family background, personality type, information processing ability and the way they attempt the exams.

AB In this paper,, we propose an effective algorithm based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for salient object detection. First, saliency maps generated by existing methods are taken as prior maps, from which training samples are collected for an ELM classifier. Second, the ELM classifier is learned to detect the salient regions, and the final results are generated by fusing multi-scale saliency maps. This ELM-based model can improve the performance of different state-of-the-art methods to a large degree. Furthermore, we present an integration mechanism to take advantages of superiorities of multiple saliency maps. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that our method performs well and the significant improvement can be achieved when applying our model to existing saliency approaches.

AB There have been growing interests in the area of recommender systems using machine learning techniques. As there are a great number of explicit and implicit features that can be used for estimating user preference, it requires scalable and accurate algorithms along with a system with high availability and scalability. Alternating least square matrix (ALS) algorithm is an enhanced version of latent factor models using matrix factorization with good scalability and predictive accuracy. Apache Spark is an open-source distributed platform for processing big data, achieving good speed and scalability suitable for iterative machine learning algorithms. Amazon offers cloud computing services with various functionality including data storage and processing engines and is highly available and scalable. In this study, we applied the ALS algorithm using Apache Spark running on an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) cluster for recommending a product with a good accuracy and enhanced scalability.

DE Neural machine translation; Cost-aware learning rate
AB Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has drawn much attention due to its promising translation performance in recent years. The conventional optimization algorithm for NMT sets a unified learning rate for each gold target word during training. However, words under different probability distributions should be handled differently. Thus, we propose a cost-aware learning rate method, which can produce different learning rates for words with different costs. Specifically, for the gold word which ranks very low or has a big probability gap with the best candidate, the method can produce a larger learning rate and vice versa. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

DE ELIDe; malware; IDS; machine learning
AB Previous work on machine learning for intrusion detection in mobile tactical networks using the extremely lightweight intrusion detection (ELIDe) system has shown that ELIDe can approximate signature-based intrusion detection using significantly less resources and power than the traditional intrusion detection system without significantly degrading accuracy. ELIDe also performs binary classification and multiclass classification on various malware that Snort cannot detect. In this paper, we demonstrate how ELIDe identifies malware within network traffic based on partially trained malware signature patterns that have significant weighted values within the classifier's weight vector. Our experiments trained ELIDe with malware signatures and network traffic without the presence of malicious traffic, and we were able to obtain the common partial patterns between the two different data sets. Based on knowledge of the common partial patterns that exist between true-negative and true-positive results from our experiments, we show that ELIDe can improve its false-positive rate without significantly affecting its false-negative rates.

ID METADATA
AB With the growth of scientific publications along with the development of science, the need for a better-automated information extraction system still remains a challenging task. The use of a knowledge-based approach (rule-based, machine learning or a combination of both) has been applied to a number of studies related to the process of extracting the reference elements. The extraction process identifies each token with features that lead to a certain type of the reference element, using one or two approaches. In this paper, we present a strategy to use a combination of three approaches (heuristic, rule-based and machine learning) to predict the constituent elements of reference from a set of tokens in a reference line. Each element, in every line of reference, can he predicted by different approaches (heuristic, rule-based or machine-based learning), depending on the need. By adding heuristics, we can directly classify one or more tokens into a certain type of the reference element without using a knowledge-based approach. Heuristic assists in the selection of the element to be extracted. A set of tokens that cannot be predicted heuristically, will be extracted by machine learning (SVM or Ripper) or rule-based (Regular Expression) to obtain the type of the reference element. Combination of rule based and heuristic also used for the process of element segmentation. Heuristic and machine learning performs the extraction process to obtain a reference type of the element. This strategy is expected to improve the accuracy of the extracted references element information. The result will be compared with the common strategy using SVM classifier and the same dataset (CORA). The experimental results show that the combined approach gives slightly better results than the result of the common approach's prediction in terms of recall measurements. Although it needs the extraction process time that longer than the common approach, in the testing phase.

AB In this paper, we propose a new regularization approach for Extreme Learning Machine-based Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Neural network training. We show that the proposed regularizer is able to weight the dimensions of the ELM space according to the importance of the network's hidden layer weights, without imposing additional computational and memory costs in the network learning process. This enhances the network's performance and makes the proposed approach suitable for learning non-linear decision surfaces in large-scale classification problems. We test our approach in medium- and large-scale face recognition problems, where we observe its superiority when compared to the existing regularized Extreme Learning Machine classifier in both constrained and unconstrained problems, thus making our approach applicable in demanding media analysis applications such as those appearing in digital cinema production.

AB As connections from the brain to an external device, Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems are a crucial aspect of assisted communication and control. When equipped with well-designed feature extraction and classification approaches, information can be accurately acquired from the brain using such systems. The Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM) has been developed as an effective and accurate classification approach due to its deep structure and extreme learning mechanism. A classification system for motor imagery EEG signals is proposed based on the HELM combined with a kernel, herein called the Kernel Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (KHELM). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is introduced to push the features away from different classes. To demonstrate the performance, the proposed system is applied to the BCI competition 2003 Dataset Ia, and the results are compared with those from state-of-the-art methods; we find that the accuracy is up to 94.54%.

AB This paper is concerned with coded machine learning: protecting machine learning algorithms from noise in test data by an informed channel coding approach. Unlike with traditional data storage, we do not seek to ensure that all test data is correctly read from storage and used as a noiseless input to the algorithm. Rather, we seek to protect data in a way that minimizes the effect on the algorithm output (i.e., minimizes a loss compared to the hypothetical noiseless output). We focus on the case where the collected test data, derived from low-power sensors and devices, is inherently noisy. We show that a smart replication strategy is an effective choice to reduce the impact on the algorithm output for linear regression algorithms. We focus on two scenarios. The first case is where the regression model is fixed, and we must allocate a fixed budget of redundancy for our replication scheme (in order to minimize the loss on the output due to noisy test data). Analyzing this case is necessary to build our understanding for the second case which is more novel. The second case involves a scenario where we may learn an optimized model and jointly protect it. We illustrate the advantages of our approach with practical experiments.

   Ensemble Pruning; Gain
AB Voting based Extreme Ensemble is a majority voting based ensemble of Extreme Learning Machines. An ensemble may contain some highly correlated classifiers. Ensemble pruning is used to remove these redundant classifiers, reduce the size of ensemble. It may also increase the accuracy of ensembles by selecting subsets of classifiers that, when combined, can perform better than the whole ensemble. This paper proposes a gain based ensemble pruning technique that adds classifiers based on their diversity and contribution towards ensemble. This algorithm reduces time complexity by reducing the size of pruning set which is done by eliminating training instances that are present far away from the decision boundary. These are the instances which are classified correctly by majority of classifiers with high confidence. Results show that the proposed algorithm works equally well or even better in some cases than Voting Based Extreme Learning Machine in terms of accuracy.

AB b Drug-related criminal activity is gradually rising in Taiwan and has a significant and negative social impact. This paper proposes a data-driven method based on "broken windows" theory and spatial analysis to analyze crime data using machine mining algorithms and thus predict emerging crime hotspots for additional police attention.
   The Deep Learning algorithm has been widely applied in several fields, include image recognition and natural language processing. With fine tuning, we find the Deep Learning algorithm provides better prediction results than other methods including Random Forest, and Naive Bayes for potential crime hotspots. Furthermore, we improve model performance by accumulating data with different time scales. To validate experimental results, we visualize potential crime hotspots on a map, and observe whether the models can identify true hotspots. Finally, we discuss the applicability of this method, and present future research directions.

AB Driven by the emerging network data exchange and storage, XML documents classification has become increasingly important. Most existing representation model and conventional learning algorithm are defined on certain XML documents. However, in many real-world applications, XML datasets contain inherent uncertainty, which brings greater challenges to classification problem.

AB Background: Data measuring airborne pollutants, public health and environmental factors are increasingly being stored and merged. These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed.
   Results: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential newdirections, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of datamining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology.
   Conclusions: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology.
   The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests thatmanymore fruitful applications can be expected in the future.

AB In our study, we sought to generate rules for cognitive distractions of car drivers using data from a driving simulation environment. We collected drivers' eye-movement and driving data from 18 research participants using a simulator. Each driver drove the same IS-minute course two times. The first drive was normal driving (no-load driving), and the second drive was driving with a mental arithmetic task (load driving), which we defined as cognitive-distraction driving. To generate rules of distraction driving using a machine-learning tool, we transformed the data at constant time intervals to generate qualitative data for learning. Finally, we generated rules using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

AB The article considers the basic methods of machine learning for applying them to the task of the lungs sounds classifying. A number of signal parameters were obtained on the basis of the lungs sounds set. The task of the study was to classify sounds using five different machine learning methods. It was also necessary to determine from a number of signal parameters those that give the highest accuracy. Thus the seven most diagnostically valuable parameters of lung sounds were found. The results showed that two methods of machine learning - the method of reference vectors and the decision tree method - have the best accuracy. Thus this classification technique can serve as an auxiliary tool for a pulmonary physician to diagnosis.

AB In this era of big data, analyzing large scale data efficiently and accurately has become a challenging problem. As one of the ELM variants, online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) provides a method to analyze incremental data. Ensemble methods provide a way to learn from data more accurately. MapReduce, which provides a simple, scalable and fault-tolerant framework, can be utilized for large scale learning. In this paper, we first propose an ensemble OS-ELM framework which supports any combination of bagging, subspace partitioning and cross validation. Then we design a parallel ensemble of online sequential extreme learning machine (PEOS-ELM) algorithm based on MapReduce for large scale learning. PEOS-ELM algorithm is evaluated with real and synthetic data with the maximum number of training data 5120K and the maximum number of attributes 512. The speedup of this algorithm reaches as high as 40 on a cluster with maximum 80 cores. The accuracy of PEOS-ELM algorithm is at the same level as that of ensemble OS-ELM executing on a single machine, which is higher than that of the original OS-ELM. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB We study online nonlinear learning over distributed multiagent systems, where each agent employs a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) structure to sequentially minimize arbitrary loss functions. In particular, each agent trains its own SLFN using only the data that is revealed to itself. On the other hand, the aim of the multiagent system is to train the SLFN at each agent as well as the optimal centralized batch SLFN that has access to all the data, by exchanging information between neighboring agents. We address this problem by introducing a distributed subgradient-based extreme learning machine algorithm. The proposed algorithm provides guaranteed upper bounds on the performance of the SLFN at each agent and shows that each of these individual SLFNs asymptotically achieves the performance of the optimal centralized batch SLFN. Our performance guarantees explicitly distinguish the effects of data-and network-dependent parameters on the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the oracle performance significantly faster than the state-of-the-art methods in the machine learning and signal processing literature. Hence, the proposed method is highly appealing for the applications involving big data.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the most important and efficient machine learning algorithms for pattern classification due to its fast learning speed. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble based ELM approach for cross-modality face matching. Different to traditional face recognition methods, the proposed approach integrates the voting-base extreme learning machine (V-ELM) with a novel feature learning based face descriptor. Firstly, the discriminant feature learning is proposed to learn the cross-modality feature representation. Then, we used common subspace learning based method to reduce the obtained cross-modality features. Finally, Voting ELM is utilized as the classifier to improve the recognition accuracy and to speed up the feature learning process. Experiments conducted on two different heterogeneous face recognition scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB Machine learning techniques have proved effective in recommender systems and other applications, yet teams working to deploy them lack many of the advantages that those in more established software disciplines today take for granted. The well-known Agile methodology advances projects in a chain of rapid development cycles, with subsequent steps often informed by production experiments. Support for such workflow in machine learning applications remains primitive.
   The platform developed at if(we) embodies a specific machine learning approach and a rigorous data architecture constraint, so allowing teams to work in rapid iterative cycles. We require models to consume data from a time ordered event history, and we focus on facilitating creative feature engineering. We make it practical for data scientists to use the same model code in development and in production deployment, and make it practical for them to collaborate on complex models.
   We deliver real-time recommendations at scale, returning top results from among 10,000,000 candidates with sub second response times and incorporating new updates in just a few seconds. Using the approach and architecture described here, our team can routinely go from ideas for new models to production-validated results within two weeks.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a kind of feed-forward single hidden layer neural network, whose input weights and thresholds of hidden layers are generated randomly. Because the output-weights of ELM are calculated by the least-square method, the ELM presents a high speed on training and testing. However, the random input-weights and thresholds of hidden layers are not the best parameters, which can not pledge the training goals of the ELM to achieve the global minimum. In order to obtain the optimal input-weights and bias of hidden layer, this paper proposes the self-adjusting extreme learning machine, called SA-ELM. Based on the idea of the ameliorated teaching learning based optimization, the input-weights and the bias of hidden layer of extreme learning machine are adjusted with "teaching phase" and "learning phase" to minimize the objective function values. The SA-ELM is applied to the eight benchmark functions to test its validity and feasibility. Compared with ELM and fast learning network, the SA-ELM owns good regression accuracy and generalization performance. Besides, the SA-ELM is applied to build the thermal efficiency model of a 300 MW pulverized coal furnace. The experiment results reveal that the proposed algorithm owns engineering practical application value.

AB Present era is full of speech recognition based services and products. The machine learning paradigms is at the centre stage of speech recognition methodology. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology has vastly evolved in recent years including emerging applications in mobile computing, natural user interface, and man-machine assistive technology. In this paper, it's the first time we are presenting ASR designs based on two important machine learning paradigms Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for an rare and geographically important Indian dialect 'Chhattisgarhi'. The conventional feed-forward ANN and SVM have been applied on the dataset of maximum 50 isolated words of 15 speakers. The performance of these machine learning paradigms is compared with state of art Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The tendency of ASR to be speaker dependent and independent has been extensively investigated with speaker variation experiments. Furthermore the reliability and stability of ASR has been confirmed with numerical validation. The exhaustive review of ASR techniques from the literature along with the ASR systems designed on Indian languages is presented.

AB In this paper, we discuss the inextricable link between automating training environment adaptation and deep understanding of the context surrounding specific decisions and actions executed in the performance environment. To enable deep contextual understanding, psychological measurement strategies are needed to more accurately and rapidly model the psychologically meaningful details of the trainee's interactions with events, objects, and people in the training environment. As these interactions often entail complex, nonlinear cue-action relationships, the underlying models must effectively capture the nuance, complexity, and largely intuitive nature of human decision-making. This paper discusses the promise of an emerging field of machine learning - deep neural networks - for supporting this requirement.

AB The high cost for new medicines is hindering their development and machine learning is therefore being used to avoid carrying out physical experiments. Here, we present a comparison between three different machine learning approaches in a classification setting where learning and prediction follow a teaching schedule to mimic the drug discovery process. The approaches are standard SVM classification, SVM based multi-kernel classification and SVM classification based on learning using privileged information. Our two main conclusions are derived using experimental in-vitro data and compound structure descriptors. The in-vitro data is assumed to i) be completely absent in the standard SVM setting, ii) be available at all times when applying multi-kernel learning, or iii) be available as privileged information during training only. The structure descriptors are always available. One conclusion is that multi-kernel learning has higher odds than standard SVM in producing higher accuracy. The second is that learning using privileged information does not have higher odds than the standard SVM, although it may improve accuracy when the training sets are small.

AB Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that is a major cause of infant mortality. Identifying the pneumococcal serotype is an important step in monitoring the impact of vaccines used to protect against disease. Genomic microarrays provide an effective method for molecular serotyping. Previously we developed an empirical Bayesian model for the classification of serotypes from a molecular serotyping array. With only few samples available, a model driven approach was the only option. In the meanwhile, several thousand samples have been made available to us, providing an opportunity to investigate serotype classification by machine learning methods, which could complement the Bayesian model.
   Results: We compare the performance of the original Bayesian model with two machine learning algorithms: Gradient Boosting Machines and Random Forests. We present our results as an example of a generic strategy whereby a preliminary probabilistic model is complemented or replaced by a machine learning classifier once enough data are available. Despite the availability of thousands of serotyping arrays, a problem encountered when applying machine learning methods is the lack of training data containing mixtures of serotypes; due to the large number of possible combinations. Most of the available training data comprises samples with only a single serotype. To overcome the lack of training data we implemented an iterative analysis, creating artificial training data of serotype mixtures by combining raw data from single serotype arrays.
   Conclusions: With the enhanced training set the machine learning algorithms out perform the original Bayesian model. However, for serotypes currently lacking sufficient training data the best performing implementation was a combination of the results of the Bayesian Model and the Gradient Boosting Machine. As well as being an effective method for classifying biological data, machine learning can also be used as an efficient method for revealing subtle biological insights, which we illustrate with an example.

AB The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and its variants are effective in many machine learning applications such as Imbalanced Learning (IL) or Big Data (BD) learning. However, they are unable to solve both imbalanced and large-volume data learning problems. This study addresses the IL problem in BD applications. The Distributed and Weighted ELM (DW-ELM) algorithm is proposed, which is based on the MapReduce framework. To confirm the feasibility of parallel computation, first, the fact that matrix multiplication operators are decomposable is illustrated. Then, to further improve the computational efficiency, an Improved DW-ELM algorithm (IDW-ELM) is developed using only one MapReduce job. The successful operations of the proposed DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms are finally validated through experiments.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks in which the parameters of hidden units are randomly generated and thus the output weights can be analytically calculated. From the hidden to output layer, ELM essentially learns the output weight matrix based on the least squares regression formula that can be used for both classification/regression and dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we impose the orthogonal constraint on the output weight matrix and then formulate an orthogonal extreme learning machine (OELM) model, which produces orthogonal basis functions and can have more locality preserving power from ELM feature space to output layer than ELM. Since the locality preserving ability is potentially related to the discriminating power, the OELM is expect to have more discriminating power than ELM. Considering the case that the number of hidden units is usually greater than the number of classes, we propose an effective method to optimize the OELM objective by solving an orthogonal procrustes problem. Experiments by pairwisely comparing OELM with ELM on three widely used image data sets show the effectiveness of learning orthogonal mapping especially when given only limited training samples.

AB In typical data mining applications, labeling the large amounts of data is difficult, expensive, and time consuming, if annotated manually. To avoid manual labeling, semi-supervised learninguses unlabeled data along withthe labeled data in the training process. Transductive support vector machine (TSVM) is one such semi-supervised, which has been found effective in enhancing the classification performance. However there are some deficiencies in TSVM, such as presetting number of the positive class samples, frequently exchange of class label, and its requirement for larger amount of unlabeled data. To tackle these deficiencies, in this paper, we propose a newsemi-supervised learning algorithm based on active learning (AL) combined with TSVM. The algorithm applies active learning to select the most informative instances based on the version space minimum-maximum division with human annotation for improve the classification performance. Simultaneously, in order to make full use of the distributioncharacteristics of unlabeled data, we addeda manifold regularization term to the objective function. Experiments performed on severalUCI datasetsdemonstrate that our proposedmethod achieves significant improvementoverother benchmark methods yet consuming less amount of human effort, which is very important while labeling data manually.

AB Machine learning (ML) is becoming a commodity. Numerous ML frameworks and services are available to data holders who are not ML experts but want to train predictive models on their data. It is important that ML models trained on sensitive inputs (e.g., personal images or documents) not leak too much information about the training data.
   We consider a malicious ML provider who supplies model-training code to the data holder, does not observe the training, but then obtains white-or black-box access to the resulting model. In this setting, we design and implement practical algorithms, some of them very similar to standard ML techniques such as regularization and data augmentation, that "memorize" information about the training dataset in the model-yet the model is as accurate and predictive as a conventionally trained model. We then explain how the adversary can extract memorized information from the model.
   We evaluate our techniques on standard ML tasks for image classification (CIFAR10), face recognition (LFW and FaceScrub), and text analysis (20 Newsgroups and IMDB). In all cases, we show how our algorithms create models that have high predictive power yet allow accurate extraction of subsets of their training data.

We validated the methods using historical data and compared the results to naive predictions that use either historical data with a delay or a vehicle speed.

AB We have a need for methods to efficiently determine the health of a system. Diagnostics and prognostics determine system heath through analysis of data from sensors. Anomalies in the data can help us determine if there is a failure or a pending failure. There are common statistical methods to detect anomalies in individual measurements. For systems with many measurements, the anomalies may occur as specific combinations of values. Large systems have various associated states and modes which define the valid measurements. The amount of data to analyze grows very quickly as the system becomes more complex. In recent years techniques have been developed to address large data analysis. Machine Learning encompasses a broad selection of tools to optimize a statistical model of the data. These tools include supervised learning techniques, such as linear regression and logistic regression, in which training data exists to tune the model. Unsupervised learning, such as clustering, is used to explore data which does not have a defined output label associated with inputs data. Standard approaches to training supervised learning systems require a large sample of positive and negative outcome data. Some uses of machine learning involve data where there are very few cases of negative outcomes. There are machine learning algorithms defined as Anomaly Detection which are designed to deal with this type of data. Simple algorithms include Gaussian Distribution Analysis, which assumes independence in distributions of data. Large Systems with anomalies defined in the dependent combinations of data require either a manual creation of combinations of independent variables, or Multivariate Gaussian Distribution Analysis, which does not scale well for large systems. A further complication is the mixture of linear and discrete data. Neural Networks are a type of learning system which has been applied to each of the individual needs addressed above. This paper describes an approach to anomaly detection using neural networks for the specific problems in large systems to efficiently determine system health.

AB Modern inspection systems based on smart sensor technology like image processing and machine vision have been widely spread into several fields of industry such as process control, manufacturing, and robotics applications in factories. Machine learning for smart sensors is a key element for the visual inspection of parts on a product line that has been manually inspected by people. This paper proposes a method for automatic visual inspection of dirties, scratches, burrs, and wears on surface parts. Imaging analysis with CNN (Convolution Neural Network) of training samples is applied to confirm the defect's existence in the target region of an image. In this paper, we have built and tested several types of deep networks of different depths and layer nodes to select adequate structure for surface defect inspection. A single CNN based network is enough to test several types of defects on textured and non-textured surfaces while conventional machine learning methods are separately applied according to type of each surface. Experiments for surface defects in real images prove the possibility for use of imaging sensors for detection of different types of defects. In terms of energy saving, the experiment result shows that proposed method has several advantages in time and cost saving and shows higher performance than traditional manpower inspection system.

AB Nowadays, the utility of an electrician must fill out a form for each work using their tablets. However, evaluation of these forms are limited, it is feasible only with manually interpretation of free text fields. The AD&TE Research Group's aim was to develop a new method for processing of the form field. For this, the group used random forest machine learning algorithms to analyze the forms filled in by the mechanics after power errors. The implemented method has over 90% accuracy in determining whether the form is filled after a certain type of fault (temporary short circuit). It has been proved, that in the investigated cases by using machine learning analysis workflows that require free text analysis can be radically simplified, and accelerated.

DE Machine translation; Deep learning
AB Deep learning is revolutionizing speech and natural language technologies since it is offering an effective way to train systems and obtaining significant improvements. The main advantage of deep learning is that, by developing the right architecture, the system automatically learns features from data without the need of explicitly designing them. This machine learning perspective is conceptually changing how speech and natural language technologies are addressed. In the case of Machine Translation (MT), deep learning was first introduced in standard statistical systems. By now, end-to-end neural MT systems have reached competitive results. This special issue introductory paper addresses how deep learning has been gradually introduced in MT. This introduction covers all topics contained in the papers included in this special issue, which basically are: integration of deep learning in statistical MT; development of the end-to-end neural MT system; and introduction of deep learning in interactive MT and MT evaluation. Finally, this introduction sketches some research directions that MT is taking guided by deep learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This note analyzes the relationship between economic crises and tourism performance in Spain during the period 1970-2013 using machine learning techniques. Specifically, a regression tree is estimated to confirm that, although the dynamics of Spanish tourism performance is influenced by the general variables established by the literature, the crisis periods disrupt the natural functioning of these dynamics, provoking disturbances that affect the tourism market position of destinations to a greater extent than expected. Conversely, to other econometric techniques, machine learning approach allows us to achieve greater flexibility and enriches the information, estimating the interrelations and thresholds operating in this context.

Various successful techniques have been proposed to solve such problems viz. Rule-based techniques, Logic-based techniques, Instance-based techniques, stochastic techniques. This paper discusses the efficacy of supervised machine learning algorithms in terms of the accuracy, speed of learning, complexity and risk of over fitting measures. The main objective of this paper is to provide a general comparison with state of art machine learning algorithms.

   REPRESENTATION
AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parameters are randomly generated and the output weights are analytically computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via l1 constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.

To solve these problems, ship rolling time series prediction, which is based on Extreme Learning Machine, was proposed. Extreme Learning Machine is a new single-hidden layer learning algorithm for Feedforward Neural Network, don't need to set up a large number of network training parameters, it's superior to the traditional Neural Network learning algorithm. The simulation experiments used multiple-input/single- output (MISO) Extreme Learning Machine prediction model and BP Neural Network prediction model. The results indicated that Extreme Learning Machine was more accurate than BP Neural Network.

AB Advanced data processing techniques with massive and high dimensional data, dramatically increased storage capability and complex data formats cause the Big data. In this realm, to solve the various issues of computational time to extract the valuable information without sensitive information loss, the Big data need modern advanced technologies and/or techniques. To overcome those problems, a novel and rapidly expanding research domain have been recently proposed: Machine Learning. Generally Machine learning algorithms have been considered to learn and find useful and valuable information from large volumes of data. The goal of this paper is to build the effective universal architecture which defines the quality and durability of a system software. The paper intends to add to the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to help specialists who are endeavoring to contribute around there. The principle target of this audit is to deliberately recognize and dissect the as of late distributed research subjects identified with Machine learning in big data as to research action, utilized apparatuses and systems, proposed methodologies and spaces. The connected strategy in SLR depends on three chose electronic databases proposed by (Kitchenham and Charters, 2007).

AB Nowadays with the rapid development of network-based services and users of the internet in everyday life, intrusion detection becomes a promising area of research in the domain of security. Intrusion detection system (IDS) can detect the intrusions of someone who is not authorized to the present computer system automatically, so intrusion detection system has emerged as an essential component and an important technique for network security.
   Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an interested area of research for detecting possible intrusions and attacks. In this paper, we propose an improved learning algorithm named self-adaptive differential evolution extreme learning machine (SADE-ELM) for classifying and detecting the intrusions. We compare our methods with commonly used ELM, DE-ELM techniques in classifications. Simulation results show that the proposed SADE-ELM approach achieves higher detection accuracy in classification case.

AB While nonlinear machine methods have been widely used in environmental forecasting, in situations where new data arrive continually, the need to make frequent model updates can become cumbersome and computationally costly. To alleviate this problem, an online sequential learning algorithm for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks - the online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) - is automatically updated inexpensively as new data arrive (and the new data can then be discarded). OSELM was applied to forecast daily streamflow at two small watersheds in British Columbia, Canada, at lead times of 1-3 days. Predictors used were weather forecast data generated by the NOAA Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS), and local hydro-meteorological observations. OSELM forecasts were tested with daily, monthly or yearly model updates. More frequent updating gave smaller forecast errors, including errors for data above the 90th percentile. Larger datasets used in the initial training of OSELM helped to find better parameters (number of hidden nodes) for the model, yielding better predictions. With the online sequential multiple linear regression (OSMLR) as benchmark, we concluded that OSELM is an attractive approach as it easily outperformed OSMLR in forecast accuracy.

The said dataset consists of features which were computed from digitized images of FNA tests on a breast mass[2]. For the implementation of the ML algorithms, the dataset was partitioned in the following fashion: 70% for training phase, and 30% for the testing phase. The hyper-parameters used for all the classifiers were manually assigned. Results show that all the presented ML algorithms performed well (all exceeded 90% test accuracy) on the classification task. The MLP algorithm stands out among the implemented algorithms with a test accuracy of approximate to 99.04%.

This feature enables the user to compare accuracy and scalability of various implementations of a machine learning technique without having to change the workflow. These actors are based on the Execution Choice actor. They can be incorporated into any workflow to provide machine learning functionality. We describe a use case where actors that provide several implementations of k-means clustering can be used in a workflow to process sensor data from weather stations for predicting wildfire risks.

AB Nowadays, developing countries face serious health issues such as Sexually Transmitted Infections, unintended pregnancies and other Reproductive Tract Infections. To tackle those health issues, customized awareness programs are necessary. To provide customized education and training to the women in developing and under developed regions, it is necessary to classify the women in those regions into different health risk segments and sub groups within the segment.
   In this paper, we discuss about a machine learning approach which will classify women into different health risk segments and sub groups based on the information collected from them. The Microsoft Women Health Risk Assessment competition was used to test the effectiveness of our machine learning model. Our approach is considered successful as we ended up in Top 10 in the competition.

ID LANDMARK RECOGNITION
AB Discriminative clustering is an unsupervised learning framework which introduces the discriminative learning rule of supervised classification into clustering. The underlying assumption is that a good partition (clustering) of the data should yield high discrimination, namely, the partitioned data can be easily classified by some classification algorithms. In this paper, we propose three discriminative clustering approaches based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The first algorithm iteratively trains weighted ELM (W-ELM) classifier to gradually maximize the data discrimination. The second and third methods are both built on Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA); but one approach adopts alternative optimization, while the other leverages kernel k-means. We show that the proposed algorithms can be easily implemented, and yield competitive clustering accuracy on real world data sets compared to state-of-the-art clustering methods.

AB The increasing availability of relevant information, events and constraints in the environment of the modern factories due to deployment of IoT sensor technologies on the production line has led to an "explosion" in contextual big data. At the same time the advancements in the machine learning field from the last years opened new approaches for the analysis of the manufacturing processes datasets that are characterized by noisy data, a large number of features and an imbalanced classification of the samples. In this paper we investigate the applicability and the impact of machine learning techniques for managing production processes considering the data from a semiconductor manufacturing process (SECOM dataset). We have applied algorithms such as Boruta and MARS for the selection of the most relevant features and the Random Forest and the Gradient Boosted Trees for the samples classification. The results show better values for precision when the features are selected using Boruta and MARS rather than PCA and better values for accuracy when the data is unsampled and classified using Random Forest and Logistic Regression rather than Gradient Boosted Trees.

AB Breast cancer is the first women health problem in the word. Early detection of breast cancer is the golden key for reduction of mortality. All the radiologists are in front of an interpretation and a decision making on a mammographic image. It has been shown that in current breast cancer screenings 8%-20% of the tumors are missed by the radiologists. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system in mammography diagnosis can be used to interpret mammography image and make decision. Thus classification into malignant and benign tumours of breast cancer is done using machine learning techniques. In this paper, we present an efficient computer aided mammogram classification using Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In this work suspicious mass recognition is its shape and the last is used as a powerful descriptor to distinguish between malignant and benign mammogram. ChanVese model for segmentation is used due to its robustness and non sensitive to noise. Once Region Of Interest (ROI) is segmented then local descriptors (shape) are extracted and use it in automatique classification. In order to validate our proposed method, the Moroccan mammographic image databases are used. Two classifiers SVM and MLP, derived on machine learning techniques, are used and compared their performances in term of accuracy. Results show that the SVM classifier based on local descriptors(shape) gives a satisfactory accuracy compared to MLP.

DE Transfer learning; Domain class imbalance; Traditional machine learning
AB Transfer learning is a subclass of machine learning, which uses training data (source) drawn from a different domain than that of the testing data (target). A transfer learning environment is characterized by the unavailability of labeled data from the target domain, due to data being rare or too expensive to obtain. However, there exists abundant labeled data from a different, but similar domain. These two domains are likely to have different distribution characteristics. Transfer learning algorithms attempt to align the distribution characteristics of the source and target domains to create high-performance classifiers. This paper provides comparative performance analysis between state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms and traditional machine learning algorithms under the domain class imbalance condition. The domain class imbalance condition is characterized by the source and target domains having different class probabilities, which can create marginal distribution differences between the source and target data. Statistical analysis is provided to show the significance of the results.

AB Titanium and its alloys are today used in many industries including aerospace, automotive, and medical device and among those Ti-6Al-4V alloy is the most suitable because of favorable properties such as high strength-to-weight ratio, toughness, superb corrosion resistance, and bio-compatibility. Machining induced surface integrity and microstructure alterations size play a critical role in product fatigue life and reliability. Cutting tool geometry, coating type, and cutting conditions can affect surface and subsurface hardness as well as grain size. In this paper, predictions of machining induced microhardness and grain size are performed by using 3D finite element (FE) simulations of machining and machine learning models. Microhardness and microstructure of machined surfaces of Ti-6Al-4V are investigated. Hardness measurements are conducted at elevated temperatures to develop a predictive model by utilizing FE-based temperature fields for hardness profile. Measured hardness, grain size, and fractions are utilized in developing predictive models. Predicted microhardness profiles and grain sizes are then utilized in understanding the effect of machining parameters such as cutting speed, tool coating, and edge radius on the surface integrity. Optimization using genetic algorithms is performed to identify most favorable tool edge radius and cutting conditions.

   predictive analysis
AB Machine learning is an emerging technique for building analytic models for machines to "learn" from data and be able to do predictive analysis. The ability of machines to "learn" and do predictive analysis is very important in this era of big data and it has a wide range of application areas. For instance, banks and financial institutions are sometimes faced with the challenge of what risk factors to consider when advancing credit / loans to customers. For several features / attributes of the customers are normally taken into consideration, but most of these features have little predictive effect on the credit worthiness or otherwise of the customer. Furthermore, a robust and effective automated bank credit risk score that can aid in the prediction of customer credit worthiness very accurately is still a major challenge facing many banks. In this paper, we examine a real bank credit data and conduct several machine learning algorithms on the data for comparative analysis and to choose which algorithms are the best fit for learning bank credit data. The algorithms gave over 80% accuracy in prediction. Furthermore, the most important features that determine whether a customer will default or otherwise in paying his / her credit the next month are extracted from a total of 23 features. We then applied these most important features on some selected machine learning algorithms and compare their predictive accuracy with the other algorithms that used all the 23 features. The results show no significant difference, signifying that these features can accurately determine the credit worthiness of the customers. Finally, we formulate a predictive model using the most important features to predict the credit worthiness of a given customer.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a competitive machine learning technique, which is much more efficient and usually lead to better generalization performance compared to the traditional classifiers. In order to further improve its performance, we proposed a novel ELM called ELM+ which introduces the privileged information to the traditional ELM method. This privileged information, which is ignored by the classical ELM but often exists in human teaching and learning, will optimize the training stage by constructing a set of correcting functions. We demonstrate the performance of ELM+ on datasets from UCI machine learning repository, Mackey-Glass time series and radar emitter recognition and also present the comparison with SVM, ELM and SVM+. The experimental results indicate the validity and advantage of our method. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Static Analysis; Machine Learning; Bug-finding
AB We present a machine-learning-based technique for selectively applying unsoundness in static analysis. Existing bug-finding static analyzers are unsound in order to be precise and scalable in practice. However, they are uniformly unsound and hence at the risk of missing a large amount of real bugs. By being sound, we can improve the detectability of the analyzer but it often suffers from a large number of false alarms. Our approach aims to strike a balance between these two approaches by selectively allowing unsoundness only when it is likely to reduce false alarms, while retaining true alarms. We use an anomaly-detection technique to learn such harmless unsoundness. We implemented our technique in two static analyzers for full C. One is for a taint analysis for detecting format-string vulnerabilities, and the other is for an interval analysis for buffer-overflow detection. The experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the recall of the original unsound analysis without sacrificing the precision.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) proposed by Huang et al. [2] is a novel algorithm for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) with extremely fast learning speed and good generalization performance. When new hidden nodes are added to the existing network, retraining the network would be time consuming, and EM-ELM [13] was proposed to calculate the output weights incrementally. However there are still two issues in EM-ELM: first, the initial hidden layer output matrix may be rank deficient thus the computation will loss accuracy; second, EM-ELM cannot always get good generalization performance due to overfitting. So we propose the improved version of EM-ELM based on regularization method called Incremental Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (IR-ELM). When new hidden node is added one by one, IR-ELM can update output weights recursively in a fast way. Enhancement of IR-ELM (EIR-ELM) that has a selection of hidden nodes to be added to the network is also introduced in this paper. Empirical studies on benchmark data sets for regression and classification problems have shown that IR-ELM (EIR-ELM) always gets better generalization performance than EM-ELM with the similar training time.

AB There has been an increasing interest in applying machine learning methods in urban energy assessment. This research implemented six statistical learning methods in estimating domestic gas and electricity using both physical and socio-economic explanatory variables in London. The input variables include dwelling types, household tenure, household composition, council tax band, population age groups, etc. Six machine learning methods are two linear approaches ( full linear and Lasso) and four non-parametric methods ( MARS multivariate adaptive regression spline, SVM support vector machine, bagging MARS, and boosting). The results indicate that all the four non-parametric models outperform two linear models. The SVM models perform the best among these models for both gas and electricity. The bagging MARS performs only a little worse than the SVM for gas use prediction. The Lasso model has similar predictive capability to the full linear model in this case. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Current models of subjective image fidelity assessment rely on two steps: feature extraction, which is usually inspired by early human vision (the eye), and pooling, which on the contrary often fails to represent the complex mechanisms of late vision (the brain). This study evaluates the feasibility of using a shallow machine learning-based model to mimic the latter. We look at how three types of machine learning algorithms (shallow neural network, support vector regression and random forest) can improve feature pooling for three of the best-performing colour image fidelity assessment indices. We demonstrate that, with only three early vision features and a shallow machine learning unit, we can achieve a prediction accuracy that is comparable to that of more complex models, based for instance on deep learning.

AB Machine learning based anti-phishing techniques are based on various features extracted from different sources. These features differentiate a phishing website from a legitimate one. Features are taken from various sources like URL, page content, search engine, digital certificate, website traffic, etc, of a website to detect it as a phishing or non-phishing. The websites are declared as phishing sites if the heuristic design of the websites matches with the predefined rules. The accuracy of the anti-phishing solution depends on features set, training data and machine learning algorithm. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Phishing attacks, their exploitation, some of the recent machine learning based approaches for phishing detection and their comparative study. It provides a better understanding of the phishing problem, current solution space in machine learning domain, and scope of future research to deal with Phishing attacks efficiently using machine learning based approaches.

AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is an eye filled illness caused by the complication of polygenic disease and that is to be detected accurately for timely treatment. As polygenic disease progresses, the vision of a patient could begin to deteriorate and leads to blindness. In this proposed work, the presence or absence of retinal exudates are detected using machine learning (ML) techniques. To detect the presence of exudates features like Mean, Standard deviation, Centroid and Edge Strength are extracted from Luv color space after segmenting the Retinal image. A total of 100 images were used, out of which 80 images were used for training and 20 images were used for testing. The classification task carried out with classifiers like Naive bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Experimental results shows that the model built using Extreme Learning Machine outperforms other two models and effectively detects the presence of exudates in retinal images.

AB Machine learning methods are becoming increasingly popular to predict protein features from sequences. Machine learning in bioinformatics can be powerful but carries also the risk of introducing unexpected biases, which may lead to an overestimation of the performance. This article espouses a set of guidelines to allow both peer reviewers and authors to avoid common machine learning pitfalls. Understanding biology is necessary to produce useful data sets, which have to be large and diverse. Separating the training and test process is imperative to avoid over-selling method performance, which is also dependent on several hidden parameters. A novel predictor has always to be compared with several existing methods, including simple baseline strategies. Using the presented guidelines will help nonspecialists to appreciate the critical issues in machine learning.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks has been widely used in classification and regression for its fast learning speed. However, a single ELM suffers from problems of stability and overfitting. Ensemble approach can effectively resolve these problems. This paper proposes a selective ensemble learning algorithm based on differential evolution (DE) for classification problem. In the proposed algorithm, ELM is selected as base classifier, and then DE algorithm is employed as the optimization technique to construct an ensemble learning model by combining base classifiers. The weights of each base classifier in the ensemble are optimized by DE algorithm. Finally, several base classifiers with larger weights are selected to form the ensemble for making decision. Experimental results on 14 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the classification accuracy and generalization ability.

AB Sentiment classification has adopted machine learning techniques to improve its precision and efficiency. However, the features are always produced by basic words-bag methods without much consideration for words' syntactic properties, which could play an important role in the judgment of sentiment meanings. To remedy this, we firstly generate syntax trees of the sentences, with the analysis of syntactic features of the sentences. Then we introduce multiple sentiment features into the basic words-bag features. Such features were trained on movie reviews as data, with machine learning methods (Naive Bayes and support vector machines). The features and factors introduced by syntax tree were examined to generate a more accurate solution for sentiment classification.

AB As more and more coding standards are developed for videos with higher resolution and higher frame rates, the conversion between them is in demand. This paper focuses on the development of fast VP9-to-HEVC transcoding algorithm. Since the decoding-and-full-re-encoding process is time consuming, we explore Naive-Bayes based machine learning algorithm to accelerate VP9-to-HEVC transcoding. The machine learning process can bridge VP9 decoding information and HEVC splitting decision throughout training results, so the HEVC CU searching process can be simplified for faster transcoding. Two new features closely related to VP9, sub-block counting and depth map, are added for VP9-to-HEVC video transcoder. Using coding features and Naive-Bayes algorithm, several models are built for different QPs and block sizes to reduce transcoding time. Experiments show that a maximum time reduction of 53% and an average reduction of 44% can be achieved and the loss of decoded image quality in BD-rate is almost ignorable.

AB As an important branch of neural network, extreme learning machines (ELMs) have attracted wide interests in the fields of pattern classification and regression estimation. However, when facing learning problems with multi-dimensional outputs, named multi-dimensional regression, the conventional ELIVls could not generally get satisfactory results because it is incapable of exploiting the relatedness among outputs efficiently. To solve this problem, a new regularized ELM is firstly proposed in this paper by introducing a hyper-spherical loss function as regularizer. As the regularization form with this loss function cannot be solved directly, an solution with iterative procedure is presented. For improving the learning performance, the algorithm proposed above is further reformulated to identify the inner grouping structure hidden in outputs by assuming that the grouping structure is determined by different linear combinations of a small number of latent basis neurons. This is achieved as a mixed integer programming, and finally an alternating minimization method is presented to solve this problem. Experiments on two multi-dimensional data sets, a toy problem and a real-life dynamical cylindrical vibration data set, are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Intrusion detection system is widely used to protect and reduce damage to information system. It protects virtual and physical computer networks against threats and vulnerabilities. Presently, machine learning techniques are widely extended to implement effective intrusion detection system. Neural network, statistical models, rule learning, and ensemble methods are some of the kinds of machine learning methods for intrusion detection. Among them, ensemble methods of machine learning are known for good performance in learning process. Investigation of appropriate ensemble method is essential for building effective intrusion detection system. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on ensemble method of machine learning is proposed. The Bagging method of ensemble with REPTree as base class is used to implement intrusion detection system. The relevant features from NSL_KDD dataset are selected to improve the classification accuracy and reduce the false positive rate. The performance of proposed ensemble method is evaluated in term of classification accuracy, model building time and False Positives. The experimental results show that the Bagging ensemble with REPTree base class exhibits highest classification accuracy. One advantage of using Bagging method is that it takes less time to build the model. The proposed ensemble method provides competitively low false positives compared with other machine learning techniques.

AB Diabetic Retinopathy is a disorder of the retina as a result of the impact of diabetes on the retinal blood vessels. It is the major cause of blindness in people like age groups between 20 & 60. Since polygenic disorder proceed, the eyesight of a patient may commence to deteriorate and causes blindness. In this proposed work, the existence or lack of retinal exudates are identified using Extreme Learning Machine(ELM). To discover the occurrence of exudates features like Mean, Standard deviation, Centroid and Edge Strength are taken out from Luv color space after segmenting the Retinal image. A total of 100 images were used, out of which 80 images were used for training and 20 images were used for testing. The classification task carried out with classifier extreme learning machine (ELM). An experimental result shows that the model built using Extreme Learning Machine outperforms other two models and effectively detects the presence of exudates in retina.

AB This paper proposes a novel regularization approach for Extreme Learning Machines. Regularization is performed using a priori spatial information expressed by an affinity matrix. We show that the use of this type of a priori information is similar to perform Tikhonov regularization. Furthermore, if a parameter free affinity matrix is used, like the cosine similarity matrix, regularization is performed without any need for parameter tuning. Experiments are performed using classification problems to validate the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the Internet age, malicious software (malware) represents a serious threat to the security of information systems. Malware-detection systems to protect computers must perform a real-time analysis of the executable files. The paper shows that machine-learning methods can support the challenging, yet critical, task of unseen malware recognition, i.e., the classification of malware variants that were not included in the training set. The experimental verification involved a publicly available dataset, and confirmed the effectiveness of the overall approach.

DE traffic classification; machine learning; methods
AB Network Traffic Classification is a central topic nowadays in the field of computer science. It is a very essential task for internet service providers (ISPs) to know which types of network applications flow in a network. Network Traffic Classification is the first step to analyze and identify different types of applications flowing in a network. Through this technique, internet service providers or network operators can manage the overall performance of a network. There are many methods traditional technique to classify internet traffic like Port Based, Pay Load Based and Machine Learning Based technique. The most common technique used these days is Machine Learning (ML) technique. Which is used by many researchers and got very effective accuracy results. In this paper, we discuss network traffic classification techniques step by step and real time internet data set is develop using network traffic capture tool, after that feature extraction tool is use to extract features from the capture traffic and then four machine learning classifiers Support Vector Machine, C4.5 decision tree, Naive Bays and Bayes Net classifiers are applied. Experimental analysis shows that C4.5 classifiers gives very good accuracy result as compare to other classifies.

DE Sarcasm identification; Twitter; Machine learning
AB In recent years, the remarkable growth in social media and microblogging platforms provide an essential source of information to identify subjective information of people, such as opinions, sentiments and attitudes. Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying subjective information from source materials towards an entity. Much of the social content online contain nonliteral language, such as irony and sarcasm, which may degrade the performance of sentiment classification schemes. In sarcastic text, the expressed text utterances and the intention of the person employing sarcasm can be completely opposite. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to sarcasm identification. In this scheme, we utilized lexical, pragmatic, dictionary based and part of speech features. We employed two kinds of features to describe lexical information: unigrams and bigrams. In addition, term-frequency, term-presence and TF-IDF based representations are evaluated. To evaluate predictive performance of different representation schemes, Naive Bayes, support vector machines, logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor classifiers are utilized.

AB Intrusion detection system plays an important role in network security. Intrusion detection model is a predictive model used to predict the network data traffic as normal or intrusion. Machine Learning algorithms are used to build accurate models for clustering, classification and prediction. In this paper classification and predictive models for intrusion detection are built by using machine learning classification algorithms namely Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. These algorithms are tested with NSL-KDD data set. Experimental results shows that Random Forest Classifier out performs the other methods in identifying whether the data traffic is normal or an attack. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB In this work, a novel supervised learning method, the Minimal Learning Machine (MLM), is proposed. Learning in MLM consists in building a linear mapping between input and output distance matrices. In the generalization phase, the learned distance map is used to provide an estimate of the distance from K output reference points to the unknown target output value. Then, the output estimation is formulated as multilateration problem based on the predicted output distance and the locations of the reference points. Given its general formulation, the Minimal Learning Machine is inherently capable of operating on nonlinear regression problems as well as on multidimensional response spaces. In addition, an intuitive extension of the MLM is proposed to deal with classification problems. A comprehensive set of computer experiments illustrates that the proposed method achieves accuracies that are comparable to more traditional machine learning methods for regression and classification thus offering a computationally valid alternative to such approaches.

AB Machine learning techniques have been widely used in many scientific fields, but its use in medical literature is limited partly because of technical difficulties. k-nearest neighbors (kNN) is a simple method of machine learning. The article introduces some basic ideas underlying the kNN algorithm, and then focuses on how to perform kNN modeling with R. The dataset should be prepared before running the knn() function in R. After prediction of outcome with kNN algorithm, the diagnostic performance of the model should be checked. Average accuracy is the mostly widely used statistic to reflect the kNN algorithm. Factors such as k value, distance calculation and choice of appropriate predictors all have significant impact on the model performance.

AB Current forecasts imply a significant increase in the quantity of lower limb amputations. Synergizing the capabilities of a conventional gait analysis system and machine learning facilitates the capacity to classify disparate types of transtibial prostheses. Automated classification of prosthesis type may eventually advance rehabilitative acuity for selecting an appropriate prosthesis for a given aspect of the rehabilitation process. The presented research utilized a force plate as a conventional gait analysis device to acquire a feature set for two types of prosthesis: passive Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel (SACH) and the iWalk BiOM powered prosthesis. The feature set consists of both temporal and kinetic data with respect to the force plate signal during stance. Intuitively a passive prosthesis and powered prosthesis generate distinctively different force plate recordings. A support vector machine, which is type of machine learning application, achieves 100% classification between a passive prosthesis and powered prosthesis regarding the feature set derived from force plate recordings.

AB Programmable biomolecules, such as DNA strands, deoxyribozymes, and restriction enzymes, have been used to solve computational problems, construct large-scale logic circuits, and program simple molecular games. Although studies have shown the potential of molecular computing, the capability of computational learning with DNA molecules, i.e., molecular machine learning, has yet to be experimentally verified. Here, we present a novel molecular learning in vitro model in which symmetric internal loops of double-stranded DNA are exploited to measure the differences between training instances, thus enabling the molecules to learn from small errors. The model was evaluated on a data set of twenty dialogue sentences obtained from the television shows Friends and Prison Break. The wet DNA-computing experiments confirmed that the molecular learning machine was able to generalize the dialogue patterns of each show and successfully identify the show from which the sentences originated. The molecular machine learning model described here opens the way for solving machine learning problems in computer science and biology using in vitro molecular computing with the data encoded in DNA molecules.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a competitive machine learning technique for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNNs), has proven to be efficient and effective algorithm for regression and classification problems. However, traditional ELM involves a large number of hidden nodes for complex real world regression and classification problems which increasing the computation burden. In this paper, a decomposition based fast ELM (DFELM) algorithm is proposed to effectively reduce the computational burden for large number of hidden nodes condition. Compared with ELM algorithm, DFELM algorithm has faster training time with a large number of hidden nodes maintaining the same accuracy performance. Experiment on three regression problems, six classification problems and a complex blast furnace modeling problem are carried out to verify the performance of DFELM algorithm. Moreover, the decomposition method can be extended to other modified ELM algorithms to further reduce the training time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB How to predict stock price movements based on quantitative market data modeling is an attractive topic. In front of the market news and stock prices that are commonly believed as two important market data sources, how to extract and exploit the hidden information within the raw data and make both accurate and fast predictions simultaneously becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we present the design and architecture of our trading signal mining platform that employs extreme learning machine (ELM) to make stock price prediction based on those two data sources concurrently. Comprehensive experimental comparisons between ELM and the state-of-the-art learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BP-NN), have been undertaken on the intra-day tick-by-tick data of the H-share market and contemporaneous news archives. The results have shown that (1) both RBF ELM and RBF SVM achieve higher prediction accuracy and faster prediction speed than BP-NN; (2) the RBF ELM achieves similar accuracy with the RBF SVM and (3) the RBF ELM has faster prediction speed than the RBF SVM. Simulations of a preliminary trading strategy with the signals are conducted. Results show that strategy with more accurate signals will make more profits with less risk.

AB Bankruptcy prediction is becoming more and more important issue in financial decision-making. It is essential to make the companies prevent from bankruptcy through building effective corporate bankruptcy prediction model in time. This study proposes an effective bankruptcy prediction model based on the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). A two-step grid search strategy which integrates the coarse search with the fine search is adopted to train KELM. The resultant bankruptcy prediction model is compared with other five competitive methods including support vector machines, extreme learning machine, random forest, particle swarm optimization enhanced fuzzy k-nearest neighbor and Logit model on the real life dataset via 10-fold cross validation analysis. The obtained results clearly confirm the superiority of the developed model in terms of classification accuracy, Type I error, Type II error and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) criterion. Promisingly, the proposed KELM can serve as a new candidate of powerful early warning systems for bankruptcy prediction with excellent performance.

AB The presence of faulty valves has been studied in the literature with various machine learning approaches. The impact of using fault data only to train the system could solve the class imbalance problem in the machine learning approach. The data sets used for fault detection contain many independent variables, where the salient ones were selected using stepwise regression and applied to various machine learning techniques. A significant test for the given regression technique was used to validate the outcome. Machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and deep learning, are applied to the given data and the results reveal that the decision tree was able to obtain more than 95% accuracy and performed better than other algorithms when considering the tradeoff between the processing time and accuracy.

AB Objective. Antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments produce inconsistent outcomes, often necessitating patients to go through several drug trials until a successful treatment can be found. This study proposes the use of machine learning techniques to predict epilepsy treatment outcomes of commonly used AEDs. Approach. Machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated using features obtained from intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings of the epileptiform discharges observed in Mecp2-deficient mouse model of the Rett Syndrome. Previous work have linked the presence of cross-frequency coupling (I-CFC) of the delta (2-5 Hz) rhythm with the fast ripple (400-600 Hz) rhythm in epileptiform discharges. Using the ICFC to label post-treatment outcomes we compared support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest (RF) machine learning classifiers for providing likelihood scores of successful treatment outcomes. Main results. (a) There was heterogeneity in AED treatment outcomes, (b) machine learning techniques could be used to rank the efficacy of AEDs by estimating likelihood scores for successful treatment outcome, (c) I-CFC features yielded the most effective a priori identification of appropriate AED treatment, and (d) both classifiers performed comparably. Significance. Machine learning approaches yielded predictions of successful drug treatment outcomes which in turn could reduce the burdens of drug trials and lead to substantial improvements in patient quality of life.

AB Nowadays with the proliferation of location aware technologies and smart phones people tend to give reviews for all types of products services and place them online. It is very important to extract knowledge or information occupies in the vast amount of available text reviews. For these, user's sentiment is also monumental. If any business owners want to take decision on future planning, they must consider their clients sentiment. In this research, we proposed a noble strategy to predict user sentiment from their online reviews given for a particular business by using supervised machine learning techniques. Our proposed machine learning model will give a hand to restaurant owners to identify their customer's feedback and market positions.

AB Machine Learning models are often composed by sequences of transformations. While this design makes easy to decompose and accelerate single model components at training time, predictions requires low latency and high performance predictability whereby end-to-end runtime optimizations and acceleration is needed to meet such goals. This paper shed some light on the problem by using a production-like model, and showing how by redesigning model pipelines for efficient execution over CPUs and FPGAs performance improvements of several folds can be achieved.

AB In this study, supporting mobile application based on machine learning in which the children can do drawing studies on basic geometric shapes is developed. Some feedback is provided to support the drawing of the children by creating a drawing platform in application. 5-class dataset consisting of straight line, triangle, rectangle, circle and ellipse shapes was created by choosing 6-8 years old children as target group for the study. Drawing data that classified with support vector machines were graded with Hausdorff distance criteria. Feedback messages supporting the drawing phases were generated according to the obtained grades.

AB Recently, more and more high resolution, high precision telescopes have been developing in the world, such as SKA[1], Arecibo[2], ALMA[2], Muser[4][5]. By aid of these modern telescopes, human acquired more and in-depth knowledge about the universe; meanwhile, a "big data" challenge was raised for astronomical big data processing. For example, the MingantU SpEctral Radioheliograph (Muser) records about 100TB raw data per month for solar radio observation. The big data firstly causes a big challenge for archiving and classifying recorded data, especially as we need the fast processing of daily recorded data. The traditional data processing was usually implemented manually before the emergence of big data, so it is no longer applicable to current big data. It is urgent to develop automatic algorithms for processing the daily recorded data efficiently and timely. Secondly, the big data also cause great difficulty in the storage and transmission of data, so data compression is highly desirable. This paper reports our efforts on big data archiving, classification and activity forecast by using machine learning, especially deep learning.

AB Multimodal data are ubiquitous in engineering, communications, robotics, computer vision, or more generally speaking in industry and the sciences. All disciplines have developed their respective sets of analytic tools to fuse the information that is available in all measured modalities. In this paper, we provide a review of classical as well as recent machine learning methods (specifically factor models) for fusing information from functional neuroimaging techniques such as: LFP, EEG, MEG, fNIRS, and fMRI. Early and late fusion scenarios are distinguished, and appropriate factor models for the respective scenarios are presented along with example applications from selected multimodal neuroimaging studies. Further emphasis is given to the interpretability of the resulting model parameters, in particular by highlighting how factor models relate to physical models needed for source localization. The methods we discuss allow for the extraction of information from neural data, which ultimately contributes to 1) better neuroscientific understanding; 2) enhance diagnostic performance; and 3) discover neural signals of interest that correlate maximally with a given cognitive paradigm. While we clearly study the multimodal functional neuroimaging challenge, the discussed machine learning techniques have a wide applicability, i.e., in general data fusion, and may thus be informative to the general interested reader.

AB Nowadays, online word-of-mouth has become a powerful influencer to marketing and sales in business. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis is frequently adopted at market research and business analytics field for analyzing word-of-mouth content. However, there still remain several challengeable areas for 1) sentiment analysis aiming for Korean word-of-mouth content in film market, 2) availability of machine learning models only using linguistic features, 3) effect of the size of the feature set. This study took a sample of 10,000 movie reviews which had posted extremely negative/positive rating in a movie portal site, and conducted sentiment analysis with four machine learning algorithms: naive Bayesian, decision tree, neural network, and support vector machines. We found neural network and support vector machine produced better accuracy than naive Bayesian and decision tree on every size of the feature set. Besides, the performance of them was boosting with increasing of the feature set size.

Audio data from both high quality and low quality sound files with varying degrees of background noise are collected and preprocessed for enhancing the learning capability of machine learning models. Then, fine-scale features are extracted to quantify acoustic properties of audio streams. Based on the proposed system, we evaluate a set of popular machine learning approaches on audio data from the cat and dog families. The experimental results show that the use of appropriate quality data and machine learning models yield compelling identification accuracy of species with limited user assistance.

AB Psychology has historically been concerned, first and foremost, with explaining the causal mechanisms that give rise to behavior. Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology's near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.

AB In this paper, we present an efficient fast learning algorithm for regression problems using meta-cognitive extreme learning machine(McELM). The proposed algorithm has two components, namely the cognitive component and meta-cognitive component. The cognitive component is an extreme learning machine (ELM) while the meta-cognitive component which controls the cognitive component employs a self-regulating learning mechanism to decide what to learn, when to learn and how to learn. The meta-cognitive component chooses suitable learning method based on the samples presented namely, delete sample, reserve sample and network update. The use of ELM improves the network speed and reduces computational cost. Unlike traditional ELM, the number of hidden layers is not fixed priori in McELM, instead, the network is built during the learning phase. This algorithm is evaluated on a set of benchmark regression and approximation problems and also on a real-world wind force and moment coefficient prediciton probelm. Performance results in this study highlight that McELM can achieve better results compared with conventional ELM, support vector regression (SVR).

AB Machine learning is growing in importance in industry, sciences, and many other fields. In many and perhaps most of these applications, users need to trade off competing goals. Machine learning, however, has evolved around the optimization of a single, usually narrowly-defined criterion. In most cases, an expert makes (or should be making) trade-offs between these criteria which requires high-level (human) intelligence. With interactive customization and optimization the expert can incorporate secondary criteria into the model-generation process in an interactive way.
   In this paper we develop the techniques to perform customized and interactive model optimization, and demonstrate the approach on several examples. The keys to our approach are (i) a machine learning architecture which is modular and supports primary and secondary loss functions, while users can directly manipulate its parameters during training (ii) high-performance training so that non-trivial models can be trained in real-time (using roofline design and GPU hardware), and (iii) highly-interactive visualization tools that support dynamic creation of visualizations and controls to match various optimization criteria.

AB Diabetic retinopathy is the most general diabetes complication that affects eyes and results in blindness. It's due to impairment of the arteries a veins located in the fundus of eye (retina) that are composed of light sensitive tissues. The aim of this research work is to design an efficient and sensitive tool for Diabetic Retinopathy using the images acquired from portable fundus camera. The screening tool is based on advanced machine learning and computer vision algorithm which includes patch level prediction. In patch level prediction algorithm will localize the diseased region in the Diabetic Retinopathy image like Hard Exudates and Hemorrhage. The patch level classification uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning classifier model to predict the potential patch of Hard Exudates and Hemorrhage. In this algorithm, the image is broken into regular rectangular patch. The feature for each patch along with the different class label based on the ground truth is computed and passed to strong classifier SVM. The data sets are split into training dataset and testing dataset. The classifier model is built on training dataset and tested against the test dataset. The performance results of rectangular patch level prediction using SVM the average performance for Hard Exudates was Accuracy 96 %, Sensitivity 94%, Specificity 96%. The average performance for Hemorrhage was Accuracy 85 %, Sensitivity 77%, and Specificity 85%.

DE Flow classification; Machine learning; Anomaly Detection
AB Network flow classification is fundamental to network management and network security. However, it is challenging to classify network flows at very high line rates while simultaneously preserving user privacy. Machine learning based classification techniques utilize only meta-information of a flow and have been shown to be effective in identifying network flows. We analyze a group of widely used machine learning classifiers, and observe that the effectiveness of different classification models depends highly upon the protocol types as well as the flow features collected from network data. We propose vTC, a design of virtual network functions to flexibly select and apply the best suitable machine learning classifiers at run time. The experimental results show that the proposed NFV for flow classification can improve the accuracy of classification by up to 13%.

DE Machine learning; Smart home; IoT
AB Recently, smart homes have become the center of Internet of Things (IoT) development. More and more connected devices are now parts of our house. These devices are considered as "smart" devices because they may be able to communicate with each other or with the Internet. However, they are not "smart" enough in a sense of learning. Most of the time, users have to manually interact with the devices to match their living style. This paper proposes a distributed machine learning method to automate the learning process for these devices to avoid making users repeat the manual interaction over and over again. Each device is able to self-learn to detect users' favorite settings during certain periods and then share this information among other self-learning smart devices to find patterns that may lead to the best combination of their settings that suit the living style of each member of the house. It implements a distributed classifier system that resulted in an algorithm that is small enough to run on lightweight single-board computers.

AB Manual creation of machine learning ensembles is a hard and tedious task which requires an expert and a lot of time. In this work we describe a new version of the GP-ML algorithm which uses genetic programming to create machine learning workows (combinations of preprocessing, classification, and ensembles) automatically, using strongly typed genetic programming and asynchronous evolution. The current version improves the way in which the individuals in the genetic programming are created and allows for much larger workows. Additionally, we added new machine learning methods. The algorithm is compared to the grid search of the base methods and to its previous versions on a set of problems from the UCI machine learning repository.

   Speech recognition; Machine Learning
AB In this paper, we address the problem of grading spontaneous speech using a combination of machine learning and crowdsourcing. Traditional machine learning techniques solve the stated problem inadequately as automatic speaker independent speech transcription is inaccurate. The features derived from it are also inaccurate and so is the machine learning model developed for speech evaluation. We propose a framework that combines machine learning with crowdsourcing. This entails identifying human intelligence tasks in the feature derivation step and using crowdsourcing to get them completed. We post the task of speech transcription to a large community of online workers (crowd). We also get spoken English grades from the crowd. We achieve 95% transcription accuracy by combining transcriptions from multiple crowd workers. Speech and prosody features are derived by force aligning the speech samples on these highly accurate transcriptions. Additionally, we derive surface and semantic level features directly from the transcription. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by predicting expert graded speech sample of 566 adult non-native speakers across two different countries - India and Philippines. Using the regression modeling technique, we are able achieve a Pearson correlation of 0.79 on the Philippines set and 0.74 on the Indian set with expert grades, an accuracy much higher than any previously reported machine learning approach. Our approach has an accuracy that rivals that of expert agreement. We show the value of the system through a case study in a real-world industrial deployment. This work is timely given the huge requirement of spoken English training and assessment.

AB In order to seek non-propagation method to train generalized single-hidden layer feed forward neural networks, extreme learning machine was proposed, which has been proven to be an effective and efficient model for both multi-class classification and regression. Different from most of existing studies which consider extreme learning machine as a classifier, we make improvements on it to let it become a feature extraction model in this paper. Specifically, a discriminative extreme learning machine with supervised sparsity preserving (SPELM) model is proposed. From the hidden layer to output layer, SPELM performs as a subspace learning method by considering the discriminative as well as sparsity information of data. The sparsity information of data is identified by solving a supervised sparse representation objective. Experiments are conducted on four widely used image benchmark data sets and the classification results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SPELM model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE) has been defined by Standard and Poor's as a frontier market. It has undergone periods where trading gains exceeded that of major markets such as the London Stock Exchange. This paper focuses on machine learning algorithms including decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines used to predict the JSE. Selected algorithms were applied to trading data over a 22 month period for price and trend forecasting and a 12-year period for volume forecasts. Experimental results show 90% accuracy in the movement prediction and 0.95 correlation coefficient for price prediction. Volume predictions were enhanced by a discretization method and support vector machine to yield over 70% accuracy.

AB This paper presents SMart-Learning, which is a set of state machine simulators for developing thinking skills. SMart-Learning handles a variant state machine diagram notation based on UML. The learners of the diagram require various thinking skills such as requirements analysis, concept formation including abstraction for a domain, and modeling conforming to the semantics. Evaluation of his/her diagram is crucial in such learning but should not enforce a needless burden on the learners when they use tools supporting the evaluation. However, usability aspects other than effectiveness of such tools has not received much attention. SMart-Learning provides three simulators to improve learners skills step by step. Through an evaluation in which five learners use SMart-Learning, the effectiveness, especially usability, is discussed.

AB In daily life, we use the internet for many purposes. The Internet makes easier our life and it has led to the providing to occur new technologies. Several smart devices that use the Internet infrastructure generates digital data in different formats and with different generation speeds. The evaluation of the generated data is carried out by the algorithms associated with the field of machine learning. When considered the large size of generated data and the diversity format of data, it has required methods such as higher performance parallel computing tools as well as machine learning algorithms. One of these tools, which is called Mahout working on Hadoop, is a big data processing tool developed for this purpose. Mahout is described as an open source framework that runs machine learning algorithms in parallel on distributed servers. In this study, the Tweets belonging to 3 daily newspapers have classified according to newspaper categories using the Naive-Bayes algorithm with Mahout framework. The proposed model achieves about % 79 success in the classification of the tweets. The classification results are tabulated in the last section of the study.

AB Generating a low-rank matrix approximation is very important in large-scale machine learning applications. The standard Nystrom method is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to generate such an approximation. It has got rapid developments since being applied to Gaussian process regression. Several enhanced Nystrom methods such as ensemble Nystrom, modified Nystrom and SS-Nystrom have been proposed. In addition, many sampling methods have been developed. In this paper, we review the Nystrom methods for large-scale machine learning. First, we introduce various Nystrom methods. Second, we review different sampling methods for the Nystrom methods and summarize them from the perspectives of both theoretical analysis and practical performance. Then, we list several typical machine learning applications that utilize the Nystrom methods. Finally, we make our conclusions after discussing some open machine learning problems related to Nystrom methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Air quality models are limited by the computational costs associated with the simulation of the complex chemical and dynamical processes of reactive pollutants in the atmosphere. We discuss here the potential usage of machine learning and reduced-order modeling techniques to mitigate some of these limitations. We first give an overview of three new methods emerging from the field of signal processing - sparse sampling, randomized matrix decompositions and the construction of reduced order models - and discuss them in the context of air quality modeling.
   In the second part we discuss the substitution of the standard chemical solver of the chemistry model with a random forest regression model trained through machine learning. We find that this approach shows promising initial results for important air pollutants such as ozone (O-3), predicting concentrations that deviate less than 10% from the values computed by the traditional model.
   The here highlighted methods all have the potential to significantly reduce the computational burden of air quality models while maintaining the model's capability to capture all features relevant to air quality. Such lightweight air quality models offer new opportunities for air quality forecasting and to assimilate the rapidly increasing array of air quality observations.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a recently proposed machine learning method with successful applications in many domains. The key strengths of ELM are its simple formulation and the reduced number of hyper-parameters. Among these hyper-parameters, the number of hidden nodes has significant impact on ELM performance since too few/many hidden nodes may lead to underfitting/overfitting. In this work, we propose a pruning strategy for ELM using the Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) as an approach to automatically find the number of hidden nodes. The SPA was originally proposed for variable selection. In this work, it is adapted in order to prune ELMs. The proposed method is compared to the Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (OP-ELM), which is considered as a state of the art method. Real world datasets were used to assess the performance of the proposed method for regression and classification problems. The application of the proposed model resulted in much simpler models with similar performance compared to the OP-ELM. For some classification instances, the performance of the proposed method outperformed the OP-ELM method.

AB In this paper, we investigate the forecasting ability of the yield curve in terms of the U.S. real GDP cycle. More specifically, within a Machine Learning framework, we use data from a variety of short (treasury bills) and long term interest rates (bonds) for the period from 1976:Q3 to 2011:Q4 in conjunction with the real GDP for the same period, to create a model that can successfully forecast output fluctuations (inflation and output gaps) around its long-run trend. We focus our attention in correctly forecasting the instances of output gaps referred for the purposes of our analysis here as recessions. In this effort, we applied a Support Vector Machines technique for classification. The results show that we can achieve an overall forecasting accuracy of 66.7 and 100 % accuracy in forecasting recessions. These results are compared to the alternative standard logit and probit model, to provide further evidence about the significance of our original model.

AB A new method for optimal sensor placement based on input variables importance of machine learned models is proposed. With its simplicity, adaptivity, and low computational cost, the method offers many advantages over existing approaches. The method is implemented on flow over an airfoil equipped with a Coanda actuator. The analysis is based on flow field data obtained from two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations with different actuation conditions. The optimal sensor locations are compared against the current de-facto standard of maximum POD modal amplitude location, and against a brute force approach that scans all possible sensor combinations. The results show that both the flow conditions and the type of sensor have an effect on the optimal sensor placement, whereas the choice of the response function appears to have limited influence.

AB The problem of graph classification has attracted much attention in recent years. The existing work on graph classification has only dealt with precise and deterministic graph objects. However, the linkages between nodes in many real-world applications are inherently uncertain. In this paper, we focus on classification of graph objects with uncertainty. The method we propose can be divided into three steps: Firstly, we put forward a framework for classifying uncertain graph objects. Secondly, we extend the traditional algorithm used in the process of extracting frequent subgraphs to handle uncertain graph data. Thirdly, based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with fast learning speed, a classifier is constructed. Extensive experiments on uncertain graph objects show that our method can produce better efficiency and effectiveness compared with other methods.

AB Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) anomalies affect network operations and, hence, their detection is of interest to researchers and practitioners. Various machine learning techniques have been applied for detection of such anomalies. In this paper, we first employ the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection algorithms to extract the most relevant features used for classifying BGP anomalies and then apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms for data classification. The SVM and LSTM algorithms are compared based on accuracy and F-score. Their performance was improved by choosing balanced data for model training.

AB Background: The selection, development, or comparison of machine learning methods in data mining can be a difficult task based on the target problem and goals of a particular study. Numerous publicly available real-world and simulated benchmark datasets have emerged from different sources, but their organization and adoption as standards have been inconsistent. As such, selecting and curating specific benchmarks remains an unnecessary burden on machine learning practitioners and data scientists.
   Results: The present study introduces an accessible, curated, and developing public benchmark resource to facilitate identification of the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning methodologies. We compare meta-features among the current set of benchmark datasets in this resource to characterize the diversity of available data. Finally, we apply a number of established machine learning methods to the entire benchmark suite and analyze how datasets and algorithms cluster in terms of performance. From this study, we find that existing benchmarks lack the diversity to properly benchmark machine learning algorithms, and there are several gaps in benchmarking problems that still need to be considered.
   Conclusions: This work represents another important step towards understanding the limitations of popular benchmarking suites and developing a resource that connects existing benchmarking standards to more diverse and efficient standards in the future.

AB Active machine learning (AML) techniques enable a machine learning model to perform better with less labeled training data. In this study, we proposed an AML approach for teaching object recognition skills to children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and compared its effects with passive learning (PL). A web and touch-based application was developed for teaching object recognition where objects were grouped according to their categories and difficulty levels. The teaching procedure was based on Applied Behavioral Analysis principles. Five children with mild to moderate levels of ASD participated in the study. An alternating treatments design of single-subject research methods was used. The results indicated that AML was more effective than PL for four out of the five participants. Consequently, they can learn faster with fewer teaching trials that are required to reach a learning criterion.

AB This paper proposes a methodology for recognition of vocal music (Byzantine music) via multi-modal signals processing. A sequence of multi-modal signals is captured from the expert's (teacher) and student's hymns performances, respectively. The machine learning system is trained using the values of particular features which are extracted from the captured multi-modal signals. After the system is being trained then it becomes able to recognize any hymn performance from the corpus. Training and recognition takes place in real time by utilizing machine learning techniques. The evaluation of the system was carried out with the cross-validation statistical method Jackknife, giving promising results.

AB Rationale, aims and objectivesEstablishing the relationship between various doses of an exposure and a response variable is integral to many studies in health care. Linear parametric models, widely used for estimating dose-response relationships, have several limitations. This paper employs the optimal discriminant analysis (ODA) machine-learning algorithm to determine the degree to which exposure dose can be distinguished based on the distribution of the response variable. By framing the dose-response relationship as a classification problem, machine learning can provide the same functionality as conventional models, but can additionally make individual-level predictions, which may be helpful in practical applications like establishing responsiveness to prescribed drug regimens.
   MethodUsing data from a study measuring the responses of blood flow in the forearm to the intra-arterial administration of isoproterenol (separately for 9 black and 13 white men, and pooled), we compare the results estimated from a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with those estimated using ODA.
   ResultsGeneralized estimating equations and ODA both identified many statistically significant dose-response relationships, separately by race and for pooled data. Post hoc comparisons between doses indicated ODA (based on exact P values) was consistently more conservative than GEE (based on estimated P values). Compared with ODA, GEE produced twice as many instances of paradoxical confounding (findings from analysis of pooled data that are inconsistent with findings from analyses stratified by race).
   ConclusionsGiven its unique advantages and greater analytic flexibility, maximum-accuracy machine-learning methods like ODA should be considered as the primary analytic approach in dose-response applications.

AB Hardware Trojans inserted at the time of design or fabrication by untrustworthy design house or foundry, poses important security concerns. With the increase in attacker's resources and capabilities, we can anticipate an unexpected new attack from the attacker at run-time. Therefore, the challenge is not only to reduce hardware overhead of added security feature but also to secure design from new attacks introduced at real-time. In this work, we propose a Real-time Online Learning approach for Securing many-core design. In order to prevent unexpected attacks, many-core provides feed-back to online learning algorithm based on core information and its behavior to incoming data packet. The proposed Online Learning approach updates the model run-time at each data transfer based on feed-back from many-core. For demonstration, Online Machine Learning model is initially trained with two types of (known) attacks and Trojan free router packets and then unexpected attack is introduced later at run-time. The results show that, feedback based Online Machine Learning algorithm has 8% higher overall detection accuracy and an average of 3% higher accuracy for unexpected attacks at each interval of 1000 test records than Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. The proposed feed-back based Trojan detection framework is demonstrated using a custom many-core architecture integrated with "Modified Balanced Winnow" Online Machine Learning algorithm on Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. Post place and route implementation results show that, secured many-core architecture requires 4 extra cycles to complete data transfer. The proposed architecture achieves 56% reduction in area and 50% less latency overhead as compared to previous published work [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate our framework for many-core platform by employing seizure detection application as a case study.

In a series of test on four datasets, we show that the additional objectives can be used to search for smaller or faster models. The algorithm is also in some cases much faster than the single-objective one while obtaining results of similar quality.

AB Fuzzy time series has been utilized to solve the problem of time series prediction in diverse fields. In the fuzzy time series prediction, the fuzzy logical relations have great impacts on the prediction performance. To obtain the exact and complex fuzzy logical relations between the fuzzy variables for the time series prediction, we propose to extract them from the historical data and model them with the ensemble extreme learning machines. In addition, we focus on the variations of the real data instead of the actual one, which can describe the patterns of the time series more precisely. Our prediction method is tested on two actual time series comparing with four prediction methods. The results demonstrate the better performance of our method and the rationality to model the fuzzy logical relationships with the ensemble extreme learning machines.

AB Shadow identification is important for food images. Different applications require an accurate shadow identification or removal. A shadow varies from one image to another based on different factors such as lighting, colors, shape of objects, and their arrangement. This makes shadow identification complex problem and lacking systematic approach. Machine learning has high potential to be used for shadow recognition if it is used to train algorithms on wide number of scenarios. In this article, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been used to identify shadow in shadow mask area. This shadow mask area was determined in the image based on edge detection, and morphological operations. ELM has been compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for shadow identification and shown better performance.

AB The purpose of this research is to implement different machine learning algorithms in optical character recognition. The algorithms used the pixel density of image of handwritten digits as an input. The algorithms when implemented produced the value of labels of each handwritten digit. The value of labels generated, was then matched with the actual value of labels of the MNIST handwritten digits to determine the accuracy of an algorithm. Machine learning algorithms that have been used for this research are Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes with Laplace Smoothing, Sequential Minimal Optimization, C4.5 decision trees and Logistic Regression. The accuracy for each of the algorithm was calculated and Logistic regression was found out to be the most accurate of them all for handwritten digits.

AB 3D shape features play a crucial role in graphics applications, such as 3D shape matching, recognition, and retrieval. Various 3D shape descriptors have been developed over the last two decades; however, existing descriptors are handcrafted features that are labor-intensively designed and cannot extract discriminative information for a large set of data. In this paper, we propose a rapid 3D feature learning method, namely, a convolutional auto-encoder extreme learning machine (CAE-ELM) that combines the advantages of the convolutional neuron network, auto-encoder, and extreme learning machine (ELM). This method performs better and faster than other methods. In addition, we define a novel architecture based on CAE-ELM. The architecture accepts two types of 3D shape representation, namely, voxel data and signed distance field data (SDF), as inputs to extract the global and local features of 3D shapes. Voxel data describe structural information, whereas SDF data contain details on 3D shapes. Moreover, the proposed CAE-ELM can be used in practical graphics applications, such as 3D shape completion. Experiments show that the features extracted by CAE-ELM are superior to existing hand-crafted features and other deep learning methods or ELM models. Moreover, the classification accuracy of the proposed architecture is superior to that of other methods on ModelNet10 (91.4%) and ModelNet40 (8435%). The training process also runs faster than existing deep learning methods by approximately two orders of magnitude. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

MPMR is developed in a probabilistic framework. It maximizes the minimum probability of future predictions being within some bound of the true regression function. ELM is the advanced learning algorithm of single-hidden layer feed forward neural network. Natural moisture content (w(n)), liquid limit (LL), void ratio (e) and plasticity index (PI) have been used as inputs of MPMR and ELM. The output of MPMR and ELM is C-c. The results of MPMR and ELM have been compared with the regression models. This study gives a powerful tool based on the developed MPMR for determination of C-c of marine clay.

AB It has become inevitable for every software developer to understand, to follow that how and why software fails, and to express reliability in quantitative terms. This has led to a proliferation of software reliability models to estimate and predict reliability. The basic approach is to model past failure data to predict future behavior. Most of the models have three major components: assumptions, factors and a mathematical function, usually high order exponential or logarithmic used to relate factors to reliability. Software reliability models are used to forecast the curve of failure rate by statistical evidence available during testing phase. They also can indicate about the extra time required to carry out the test procedure in order to meet the specifications and deliver desired functionality with minimum number of defects. Therefore there are challenges whether, autonomous or machine learning techniques like other predictive methods could be able to forecast the reliability measures for a specific software application. This chapter contemplates reliability issue through a generic Machine Learning paradigm while referring the most common aspects of Support Vector Machine scenario. Couples of customized simulation and experimental results have been presented to support the proposed reliability measures and strategies.

AB In Machine Learning, we often encounter instances of imbalanced data which occur whenever there is an unequal representation in the classification categories. New found interest in Machine Learning has made its usage ubiquitous. Its applications encompass a wide plethora of scenarios ranging from Business and Banking to Bioinformatics and Psychology. These problems are often characterized by imbalanced data, the presence of which often leads to inaccurate predictive models, since the distribution of testing data may differ from that of training data while learning, leading to misclassification of the response variable. The primary focus of the paper is on Credit Risk which is defined as the probability of defaulting on the loan or credit acquired from a banking or financial institution. The base risk is that of the loss of primary principal and interest, disruption of cash flows and increased collection costs. Loan Default is an uncommon phenomena, henceforth we obtain the imbalanced data. We've adopted the approach of Logistic Regression and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) with techniques such as undersampling, Prior Probabilities, Loss Matrix and Matrix Weighing to deal with imbalanced data.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) not only is an effective classifier in supervised learning, but also can be applied on unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. The model structure of unsupervised extreme learning machine (US-ELM) and semi-supervised extreme learning machine (SS-ELM) are same as ELM, the difference between them is the cost function. We introduce kernel function to US-ELM and propose unsupervised extreme learning machine with kernel (US-KELM). And SS-KELM has been proposed. Wavelet analysis has the characteristics of multivariate interpolation and sparse change, and Wavelet kernel functions have been widely used in support vector machine. Therefore, to realize a combination of the wavelet kernel function, US-ELM, and SS-ELM, unsupervised extreme learning machine with wavelet kernel function (US-WKELM) and semi-supervised extreme learning machine with wavelet kernel function (SS-WKELM) are proposed in this paper. The experimental results show the feasibility and validity of US-WKELM and SS-WKELM in clustering and classification.

AB In this paper, a novel frame work of reinforcement learning for continuous time dynamical system is presented based on the Hamiltonian functional and extreme learning machine. The idea of solution search in the optimization is introduced to find the optimal control policy in the optimal control problem. The optimal control search consists of three steps: evaluation, comparison and improvement of arbitrary admissible policy. The Hamiltonian functional plays an important role in the above framework, under which only one critic is required in the adaptive critic structure. The critic network is implemented by the extreme learning machine. Finally, simulation study is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the presented algorithm.

AB The availability of intelligent embedded system to assist the classification application is a great challenge in machine learning field in last few decades. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is one of the best learning methods for the implementation due to its classification accuracy and speed. The main computational effort of ELM is to compute the pseudo-inverse of hidden layers output. This work presents a Modified Gram-Schmidt QR decomposition (MGS-QRD) method and hardware architecture for the FPGA implementation of ELM system. The proposed algorithm is implemented on MATLAB and compared with ordinary ELM computational methods. Next, an embedded ELM system is presented, where the software part is developed using C language and hardware is created on field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieve better performance than original ELM computational method. Finally, the investigation is performed by altering the activation function and number of hidden neurons, providing a guideline on selecting the best parameter for classification.

AB This paper proposes two deep learning modes which combine sparse auto-encoder with extreme learning machine (ELM) and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), namely as Stacked Sparse Auto-encoder-Extreme Learning Machine and Stacked Sparse Auto-encoder-Kernel Extreme Learning Machine. The proposed models are applied to the image recognition task. To learn features from the original input data, SSAE with deep architecture is employed. Then, to construct a unified neural network learning model, ELM and KELM are selected to classify the extracted features. To evaluate the performance of the two proposed models, we carry out experiments on three different image data sets respectively. The results show that the proposed models' performance can be not only superior to the shallow architecture models of Support Vector Machine, ELM and KELM but also better than the deep architecture models, such as Stacked Auto-encoder, Deep Belief Network and Stacked Denoising Auto-encoder.

AB One of the greatest challenges of today's rule-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is the largest value of its false positive rate which makes rule-based NIDS system unreliable. To avoid large values of false positive rate, a hybrid system based on multiple intrusion detectors in series has been proposed in this research paper. The proposed system uses a rule-based learning and machine learning classification to automatically detect attacks more precisely against computer networks and systems automatically. Our approach uses two different learning styles in series to detect network intrusions. First, we use a rule-based system to identify incoming network packets as an intrusion or normal packets, and then use trained model of machine learning classifier to further validate whether the incoming packets are intruding or normal packets. For the rule-based system, we use "SNORT" and for machine learning classification we use simple logistic, J48 and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). The final decision about intrusions is based on the prediction of both the learning systems, we use "OR" gate logic on the output of both the detectors to identify attack more precisely. Our experimental results show that our approach can successfully reduce the false positive and false negative rate of rule-based NIDS.

AB Amplifying human ability for controlling complex environments featuring autonomous units can be aided by learned models of human and system performance. In developing a command and control system that allows a small number of people to control a large number of autonomous teams, we employ an autonomics framework to manage the networks that represent mission plans and the networks that are composed of human controllers and their autonomous assistants. Machine learning allows us to build models of human and system performance useful for monitoring plans and managing human attention and task loads. Machine learning also aids in the development of tactics that human supervisors can successfully monitor through the command and control system.

AB Actuator fault might occur during quadrotor helicopter's flight. It is a demand to detect actuator fault in real-time. An actuator fault detection method based on extreme learning machine is proposed. An extreme learning machine network is used to approximate the dynamic of the actuator, which is trained by the actuator's inputs, outputs, and states. The dynamic of the actuator is mapped to the output matrix of the proposed extreme learning machine network. By monitoring the norm of the output matrix, the dynamic of the actuator is supervised, and system fault can be detected. The proposed extreme learning machine network is tested on a self-made experimental propeller system platform, and results show that the method is sensitive and effective on both major and minor fault circumstances.

AB With the growth of internet world has transformed into a global market with all monetary and business exercises being carried online. Being the most imperative resource of the developing scene, it is the vulnerable object and hence needs to be secured from the users with dangerous personality set. Since the Internet does not have focal surveillance component, assailants once in a while, utilizing varied and advancing hacking topologies discover a path to bypass framework's security and one such collection of assaults is Intrusion. An intrusion is a movement of breaking into the framework by compromising the security arrangements of the framework set up. The technique of looking at the system information for the conceivable intrusions is known intrusion detection. For the last two decades, automatic intrusion detection system has been an important exploration point. Till now researchers have developed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with the capability of detecting attacks in several available environments; latest on the scene are Machine Learning approaches. Machine learning techniques are the set of evolving algorithms that learn with experience, have improved performance in the situations they have already encountered and also enjoy a broad range of applications in speech recognition, pattern detection, outlier analysis etc. There are a number of machine learning techniques developed for different applications and there is no universal technique that can work equally well on all datasets. In this work, we evaluate all the machine learning algorithms provided by Weka against the standard data set for intrusion detection i.e. KddCupp99. Different measurements contemplated are False Positive Rate, precision, ROC, True Positive Rate.

AB In this paper, we propose an approximation scheme of the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine algorithm for Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Neural network training that can be used for large scale classification problems. The Approximate Kernel Extreme Learning Machine is able to scale well in both computational cost and memory, while achieving good generalization performance. Regularized versions and extensions in order to exploit the total and within-class variance of the training data in the feature space are also proposed. Extensive experimental evaluation in medium-scale and large-scale classification problems denotes that the proposed approach is able to operate extremely fast in both the training and test phases and to provide satisfactory performance, outperforming relating classification schemes.

AB Machine Learning algorithms have a broad applicability, although generally a huge effort is necessary to find a good configuration for a given task. The tuning of free parameters, for example, is a task that directly affects the algorithm's performance but is often carried out as an ad hoc process. An alternative approach is to define the problem as a search in the parameters space, which can be computationally expensive and slow. Furthermore, to apply an algorithm to a different problem, all the work must be done from scratch. Transfer learning can be used to avoid this rework. In this paper we propose an approach to tune the parameter by means of transfer learning. The idea is to use data complexity characterization measures to evaluate the similarity among datasets and evaluate whether they share similar configurations of good parameters. To compare our approach, four performance measures were used: area under ROC Curve (AUC), accuracy, F1 and area under Precision-Recall Curve. Results show that the proposed approach may reduce the search space for the parameter tuning by exploiting parameter recommendation of similar datasets and provide competitive performance compared to other widely used techniques.

AB Machine learning domain has grown quickly the last few years, in particular in the mobile eHealth domain. In the context of the D1NAMO project, we aimed to detect hypoglycemia on Type 1 diabetes patients by using their ECG, recorded with a sport-like chest belt. In order to know if the data contain enough information for this classification task, we needed to apply and evaluate machine learning algorithms on several kinds of features. We have built a Python toolbox for this reason. It is built on top of the scikit-learn toolbox and it allows evaluating a defined set of machine learning algorithms on a defined set of features extractors, taking care of applying good machine learning techniques such as cross-validation or parameters grid-search. The resulting framework can be used as a first analysis toolbox to investigate the potential of the data. It can also be used to fine-tune parameters of machine learning algorithms or parameters of features extractors. In this paper we explain the motivation of such a framework, we present its structure and we show a case study presenting negative results that we could quickly spot using our toolbox.

AB In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to solving multiclass problems which combines evolutionary computation with elements of traditional machine learning. The method, Grammatical Evolution Machine Learning (GEML) adapts machine learning concepts from decision tree learning and clustering methods and integrates these into a Grammatical Evolution framework. We investigate the effectiveness of GEML on several supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised multiclass problems and demonstrate its competitive performance when compared with several well known machine learning algorithms. The GEML framework evolves human readable solutions which provide an explanation of the logic behind its classification decisions, offering a significant advantage over existing paradigms for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. In addition we also examine the possibility of improving the performance of the algorithm through the application of several ensemble techniques.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel extension of the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm for single-hidden layer feedforward neural network training that is able to incorporate subspace learning (SL) criteria on the optimization process followed for the calculation of the network's output weights. The proposed graph embedded ELM (GEELM) algorithm is able to naturally exploit both intrinsic and penalty SL criteria that have been (or will be) designed under the graph embedding framework. In addition, we extend the proposed GEELM algorithm in order to be able to exploit SL criteria in arbitrary (even infinite) dimensional ELM spaces. We evaluate the proposed approach on eight standard classification problems and nine publicly available datasets designed for three problems related to human behavior analysis, i.e., the recognition of human face, facial expression, and activity. Experimental results denote the effectiveness of the proposed approach, since it outperforms other ELM-based classification schemes in all the cases.

AB Increased globalisation and competition are drivers for process analytical technologies (PAT) that enable seamless process control, greater flexibility and cost efficiency in the process industries. The paper will discuss process modelling and control for industrial applications with an emphasis on solutions enabling the real-time data analytics of sensor measurements that PAT demands.
   This research aims to introduce an integrated process control approach, embedding novel sensors for monitoring in real time the critical control parameters of key processes in the minerals, ceramics, non-ferrous metals, and chemical process industries.
   The paper presents a comparison of machine learning algorithms applied to sensor data collected for a polymerisation process. Several machine learning algorithms including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems, Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms were implemented using MATLAB (R) Software and compared in terms of accuracy (MSE) and robustness in modelling process progression. The results obtained show that machine learning-based approaches produce significantly more accurate and robust process models compared to models developed manually while also being more adaptable to new data. The paper presents perspectives on the potential benefits of machine learning algorithms with a view to their future in the industrial process industry.

AB Herbal medicines are vigorously marketed, but poorly regulated. Analysis methodology for this field is still forming. One particular analytical task is confirmation of plant species identity for medicinal plants used as ingredients. In this work, machine learning approach has been implemented for LC-MS plant species identification. Samples for 36 plant species have been analyzed. Peak data (m/z, abundance) from respective samples have been used for development of classification algorithms. Namely, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) techniques were used. For most of used machine learning algorithms, classification accuracy of 95% higher were obtained on cross-validation dataset. Now, massive training datasets are needed for full-scale application of this approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a method to classify the arm movements into 8 categories for the sensor data acquired from a micro-electro-mechenial sensor. The method uses the attribute weighted KNN (AWKNN) which is a kind of machine learning algorithm. The measurement system consists of gyroscopes and an accelerometer, attached to a human arm to measure arm movement. The system has been implemented with field-programmable gate array. The sensor data are pre-processed and handed over the AWKNN-based machine learning classifier to classify the sensed arm movements into 8 classes. The training data sets have been collected from the group of men and women who had exercised the predefined arm movements. The developed arm movement recognition system has achieved the accuracy higher than 90% in the experiments.

AB The main aim of this paper is to stress the fact that the sufficient variability of activation functions (AF) is important for an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) approximation accuracy and applicability. A slight modification of the standard ELM procedure is proposed, which allows increasing the variance of each AF, without losing too much from the simplicity of random selection of parameters. The proposed modification does not increase the computational complexity of an ELM training significantly. Enhancing the variation of AFs results in reduced output weights norm, better numerical conditioning of the output weights calculation, smaller errors for the same number of the hidden neurons. The proposed approach works efficiently together with the Tikhonov regularization of ELM.

AB In recent years, location-based social networks have become very popular. However, it is difficult to extract proper location features from constrained users' check-in activities datasets. In this paper, by capturing the check-in activities of similar users, we propose a new extracting location feature method similar user pattern (SUP) to automatically annotate category tags for all locations lacking semantic tags. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is well-known for having a faster learning speed and good generalization performance, so we apply a binary ELM to train extracting location features for each tag in the tag space in order to support multi-label classification. We also combined with other existing feature extraction methods to train ELM aimed for finding the most effective feature combinations for annotating semantic tags. Finally, to verify the effectiveness and efficiency, we conduct experimental study based on a real dataset collected from Foursquare, which is popular LBSN service. The results show that our proposed method SUP is effective in annotating semantic tag for locations.

AB In order to improve the sparsity of kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM), this paper proposed a novel method named dual reduced kernel extreme learning machine (DR-KELM). The proposed algorithm incorporates traditional greedy forward learning algorithm into backward learning algorithm to gain more sparsity and enhance testing time further. Compared to original KELM, the proposed method produces satisfactory performance of pattern recognition with fewer nodes, and reduces diagnostic consuming time from the tests on benchmark dataset. The DR-KELM application to aero-engine fault diagnosis also demonstrates its superior performance with more sparse structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Network analysis has recently become in one of the most challenging tasks to handle due to the rapid growth of communication technologies. For network management, accurate identification and classification of network traffic is a key task. For example, identifying traffic from different applications is critical to manage bandwidth resources and to ensure Quality of Service objectives. Machine learning emerges as a suitable tool for traffic classification; however, it requires several steps that must be followed adequately in order to achieve the goals. In this paper, we proposed an architecture to perform traffic analysis based on Machine Learning techniques and autonomic computing. We analyze the procedures to perform Machine Learning over traffic network classification, and at the same time we give guidelines to introduce all these procedures into the architecture proposed. The main contribution of our proposal is the reconfiguration of the traffic classifier that will change according to the knowledge acquired from the traffic analysis process.

AB Brain computer interface (BCI) is a technology that controls computers or machines using the thoughts or intentions of a person. EEG signal measured from the human scalp is reflected with thoughts and intentions of a person, and when using the signal processing technologies such as machine learning or pattern recognition, intentions of such users can be interpreted. This study has proposed an autonomous machine learning method applicable to BCI based on Kohonen's self-organizing map which is one of the representative methods of unsupervised learning. To achieve this, learning area adjustment method and autonomous machine learning rules using interactive functions were proposed. Learning area adjustment and machine learning have used the side control effects according to the interactive functions based on Kohonen's self-organizing map. After determining the winning neuron, the connection strength of neuron was adjusted according to the learning rules. As the learning area gradually decreased according to the increase in the number of learning, the flow towards the input of weighted value of output layer neuron was mitigated and an autonomous machine learning that can complete the learning as the network reaches the equilibrium state was proposed. This BCI technology that connects the brain and machines is predicted to be applicable to a variety of BCI applications in that unlike the existing manual mechanism, it is applied with person's brainwaves.

AB In recent years we are witnessing a rapid increase in the diffusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, with a large scale adoption of interconnected heterogeneous devices that are pervasively collecting information through the interaction with humans in their environment. The adoption of Machine Learning (ML) methodologies can play a fundamental role, allowing smarter IoT applications to continuously adapt to evolving environmental conditions and user's needs. In this context, the time is now ripe for a decisive step forward in the direction of a systematic integration of ML functionalities within the IoT platform.
   In this paper, we outline the principles that should guide the realization of a ML service for the IoT, proposing a conceptual architecture of such a learning service, integrated within the IoT reference model. Our proposal leverages on the experience of recent successful European initiatives that led to the realization of intelligent sensor networks built on the synergy between resource efficient ML models for temporal data processing and wireless sensor networks. The relevant impact of ML in applicative domains of interest for the IoT is also enucleated through a brief summary of recent results.

AB Machine learning is widely used for mining collections, such as images, sounds, or texts, by classifying their elements into categories. Automatic classification based on supervised learning requires groundtruth datasets for modeling the elements to classify, and for testing the quality of the classification. Because collecting groundtruth is tedious, a method for estimating the potential errors in large datasets based on limited groundtruth is needed. We propose a method that improves classification quality by using limited groundtruth data to extrapolate the potential errors in larger datasets. It significantly improves the counting of elements per class. We further propose visualization designs for understanding and evaluating the classification uncertainty. They support end-users in considering the impact of potential misclassifications for interpreting the classification output. This work was developed to address the needs of ecologists studying fish population abundance using computer vision, but generalizes to a larger range of applications. Our method is largely applicable for a variety of Machine learning technologies, and our visualizations further support their transfer to end-users.

AB In this paper, a model based on weighted extreme learning machine (weighted ELM) is proposed for visual tracking. The weighted ELM considers different class distributions both of the positive and negative classes, where extra weights are utilized in the framework. The proposed model simultaneously trains a certain number of weighted ELMs with different feature blocks. Moreover, the weighted multiple instance learning (weighted MI-L) scheme is utilized in choosing the network with the greatest feature block, which has the most discriminative ability. In addition, a special method of calculating global output weights in weighted ELMs is introduced into the tracking framework. Experimental results on some video clips illustrate the good tracking ability of our tracker in many challenging circumstances.

AB Open refrigeration showcases are commonly utilized equipment in super markets and convenience stores to maintain the temperature and quality of foods and drinks. Often set in a broader refrigeration arrangement, where a number of showcases and outdoor condensers are connected, it is a system that remains susceptible to fault events, which can lead to financial losses for stores. Therefore, faults and early abnormal behaviors that can lead to future problems should be identified. To classify events as in-control of faulty, samples or patterns for both types of events are needed, however, it is often the case in practical industrial applications where only the in-control type of data is available. This paper assesses the applicability of the machine learning approaches for supervised and unsupervised learning in the task of identifying unusual behavior in real showcase data.

AB Background-The current ability to predict readmissions in patients with heart failure is modest at best. It is unclear whether machine learning techniques that address higher dimensional, nonlinear relationships among variables would enhance prediction. We sought to compare the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms for predicting readmissions.
   Methods and Results-Using data from the Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes trial, we compared the effectiveness of random forests, boosting, random forests combined hierarchically with support vector machines or logistic regression (LR), and Poisson regression against traditional LR to predict 30-and 180-day all-cause readmissions and readmissions because of heart failure. We randomly selected 50% of patients for a derivation set, and a validation set comprised the remaining patients, validated using 100 bootstrapped iterations. We compared C statistics for discrimination and distributions of observed outcomes in risk deciles for predictive range. In 30-day all-cause readmission prediction, the best performing machine learning model, random forests, provided a 17.8% improvement over LR (mean C statistics, 0.628 and 0.533, respectively). For readmissions because of heart failure, boosting improved the C statistic by 24.9% over LR (mean C statistic 0.678 and 0.543, respectively). For 30-day all-cause readmission, the observed readmission rates in the lowest and highest deciles of predicted risk with random forests (7.8% and 26.2%, respectively) showed a much wider separation than LR (14.2% and 16.4%, respectively).
   Conclusions-Machine learning methods improved the prediction of readmission after hospitalization for heart failure compared with LR and provided the greatest predictive range in observed readmission rates.

   LOCI; SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
AB Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex psychiatric disease with a moderate to strong genetic contribution. In addition to conventional genome wide association (GWA) studies, researchers have been using machine learning methods in conjunction with genomic data to predict risk of diseases in which genetics play an important role.
   Methods: In this study, we collected whole genome genotyping data on 3940 AN cases and 9266 controls from the Genetic Consortium for Anorexia Nervosa (GCAN), the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 3 (WTCCC3), Price Foundation Collaborative Group and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and applied machine learning methods for predicting AN disease risk. The prediction performance is measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), indicating how well the model distinguishes cases from unaffected control subjects.
   Results: Logistic regression model with the lasso penalty technique generated an AUC of 0.693, while Support Vector Machines and Gradient Boosted Trees reached AUC's of 0.691 and 0.623, respectively. Using different sample sizes, our results suggest that larger datasets are required to optimize the machine learning models and achieve higher AUC values.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to assess AN risk based on genome wide genotype level data. Future integration of genomic, environmental and family-based information is likely to improve the AN risk evaluation process, eventually benefitting AN patients and families in the clinical setting.

Focusing on the relationship between uncertainty of an ELM's output on the training set and the ELM's generalization capability, the experiments show some new results in the viewpoint of classical pattern recognition. The study provides some useful guidelines to choose a fraction of ELMs with better generalization from an ensemble for classification problems.

AB As the information technology develops rapidly, Web servers are easily to be attacked because of their high value. Therefore, Web security has aroused great concern in both academia and industry. Anomaly detection plays a significant role in the field of Web security, and log messages recording detailed system runtime information has become an important data analysis object accordingly. Traditional log anomaly detection relies on programmers to manually inspect by keyword search and regular expression match. Although the programmers can use intrusion detection system to reduce their workload, yet the log system data is huge, attack types are various, and hacking skills are improving, which make the traditional detection not efficient enough. To improve the traditional detection technology, many of anomaly detection mechanisms have been proposed in recent years, especially the machine learning method. In this paper, an anomaly detection system for web log files has been proposed, which adopts a two-level machine learning algorithm. The decision tree model classifies normal and anomalous data sets. The normal data set is manually checked for the establishment of multiple HMMs. The experimental data comes from the real industrial environment where log files have been collected, which contain many true intrusion messages. After comparing with three types of machine learning algorithms used in anomaly detection, the experimental results on this data set suggest that this system achieves higher detection accuracy and can detect unknown anomaly data.

We use machine learning to classify whether an application is benign or malware. Furthermore, we compare classification precision rate from machine learning. This research uses 51 APIs package classes from 16 APIs classes and employs cross validation and percentage split test to classify benign and malware using Random Forest, J48, and Support Vector Machine algorithms. We use 412 total application samples (205 benign, 207 malware). We obtain that the classification precision average is 91.9%.

DE Resource Allocation; Cloud Application; Machine Learning
AB With the rapid development of WEB applications, the demand for dynamically adjusting computing resources based on the load variation is increasing. However, most of the traditional WEB systems have limited ability to respond to load changes. In order to solve the problem, software self-adaptation technology has been applied to the resource management of WEB systems. Many researchers have tried to propose various software self-adaptation models, all of which contain the control loop "Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute". However, the "Knowledge-base" of these models is based on predefined strategy or configuration, which increases the complexity of system development and maintenance. In this paper, machine learning is applied to software self-adaptation through a case study, and the "Knowledge-base" is given by machine learning, which greatly reduces the workload of system maintenance and rule configuration. The results show the case based on machine learning can construct the corresponding management strategy according to WEB system runtime status, and conduct software self-adaptive management.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES

DT Article
DE Knowledge; machine learning; media; power; prediction
AB Retail, media, finance, science, industry, security and government increasingly depend on predictions produced through techniques such as machine learning. How is it that machine learning can promise to predict with great specificity what differences matter or what people want in many different settings? We need, I suggest, an account of its generalization if we are to understand the contemporary production of prediction. This article maps the principal forms of material action, narrative and problematization that run across algorithmic modelling techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees and Naive Bayes classifiers. It highlights several interlinked modes of generalization that engender increasingly vast data infrastructures and platforms, and intensified mathematical and statistical treatments of differences. Such an account also points to some key sites of instability or problematization inherent to the process of generalization. If movement through data is becoming a principal intersection of power relations, economic value and valid knowledge, an account of the production of prediction might also help us begin to ask how its generalization potentially gives rise to new forms of agency, experience or individuations.

AB Manuscript type: Research paper.
   Research aim: This paper aims to enhance Earnings Manipulation Detection (EMD) by applying the Bayesian Naive Classifier (BNC), a supervised machine learning approach which evaluates and compares the manual auditors' method with a widely applied mathematical model (Beneish model).
   Design/ Methodology/ Approach: The data set consists of financial statements of 53 companies over years 2006 to 2009. Three data sets were created: training data set using financial statements from 2006 to 2007, and two test data sets made up of financial statements from 2008 to 2009. The Beneish model and the manual auditors' method are used to test for EMD accuracy as well as to evaluate results. In the process of testing and comparing the two methods, a new layer of supervised machine learning technique namely the BNC is introduced.
   Research findings: The analysis of results for the EMD shows that the Beneish model outperforms the manual auditors' method. The results also reveal a higher classification rate (86.84 per cent) when using the Beneish model as compared to the manual auditors' method (60.53 per cent). This difference indicates that the manual auditors' method is less effective in detecting earnings manipulation.
   Theoretical contribution/ Originality: The main contribution of this research is the introduction of the supervised machine learning approach as a new layer in the framework of EMD. This approach can be used to broaden the scope for auditors, forensic accountants, tax controllers, and other manipulation detectors who are involved in the auditing procedures.
   Practitioner/ Policy implication: The results of this study will help regulators and practitioners to re-define their overall strategic decision-making in detecting accounting manipulations.
   Research limitation: This study devised a framework for EMD using the Beneish model and machine learning approach for companies operating in wholesale liquid fuel industry. Further studies need to be conducted to examine the application of such methods in other industries. In addition, future studies may need to assess the potential of other manipulation detection models which could be applied together with different machine learning tools.

AB Computer vision and machine learning methods were applied to the challenge of automatic microstructure recognition. Here, a case study on dendritic morphologies was performed. Two classification tasks were completed, and involved distinguishing between micrographs that depict dendritic morphologies from those that do not contain this particular microstructural feature (Task 1), and from those micrographs identified as depicting dendrites, different cross-sectional views (longitudinal or transverse) were identified (Task 2). Data sets were comprised of images taken over a range of magnifications, from materials with different compositions and varying orientations of microstructural features. Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction were performed prior to training machine learning algorithms to classify microstructural image data. Visual bag of words, texture and shape statistics, and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (deep learning algorithms) were used for feature extraction. Classification was then performed using support vector machine, voting, nearest neighbors, and random forest models. For each model, classification was completed using full (original size) and reduced feature vectors for each feature extraction method tested. Performance comparisons were done to evaluate all possible combinations of feature extraction, selection, and classifiers for the task of micrograph classification. Results demonstrate that pre-trained neural networks represent microstructure image data well, and when used for feature extraction yield the highest classification accuracies for the majority of classifier and feature selection methods tested. Thus, deep learning algorithms can successfully be applied to micrograph recognition tasks. Maximum classification accuracies of 91.85 +/- 4.25% and 97.37 +/- 3.33% for Tasks 1 and 2 respectively, were achieved. This work is a broad investigation of computer vision and machine learning methods that acts as a step towards applying these established methods to more sophisticated materials recognition or characterization tasks. The approach presented here could offer improvements over established stereological measurements by removing the requirement of expert knowledge (bias) for interpretation of image data prior to characterization.

DE Adversarial machine learning; Android malware detection; Evasion attack
ID SELECTION
AB With explosive growth of Android malware and due to its damage to smart phone users, the detection of Android malware is one of the cybersecurity topics that are of great interests. To protect legitimate users from the evolving Android malware attacks, systems using machine learning techniques have been successfully deployed and offer unparalleled flexibility in automatic Android malware detection. Unfortunately, as machine learning based classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we explore the security of machine learning in Android malware detection on the basis of a learning-based classifier with the input of Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from the smali files. In particular, we consider different levels of the attackers' capability and present a set of corresponding evasion attacks to thoroughly assess the security of the classifier. To effectively counter these evasion attacks, we then propose a robust secure-learning paradigm and show that it can improve system security against a wide class of evasion attacks. The proposed model can also be readily applied to other security tasks, such as anti-spam and fraud detection.

AB Academic motivation is closely related to academic performance. For educators, it is equally important to detect early students with a lack of academic motivation as it is to detect those with a high level of academic motivation. In endeavouring to develop a classification model for predicting student academic motivation based on their behaviour in learning management system (LMS) courses, this paper intends to establish links between the predicted student academic motivation and their behaviour in the LMS course. Students from all years at the Faculty of Education in Osijek participated in this research. Three machine learning classifiers (neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines) were used. To establish whether a significant difference in the performance of models exists, a t-test of the difference in proportions was used. Although, all classifiers were successful, the neural network model was shown to be the most successful in detecting the student academic motivation based on their behaviour in LMS course.

ID SIMILARITY; FRAMEWORK
AB Distance metric learning aims to learn from the given training data a valid distance metric, with which the similarity between data samples can be more effectively evaluated for classification. Metric learning is often formulated as a convex or nonconvex optimization problem, while most existing methods are based on customized optimizers and become inefficient for large scale problems. In this paper, we formulate metric learning as a kernel classification problem with the positive semi-definite constraint, and solve it by iterated training of support vector machines (SVMs). The new formulation is easy to implement and efficient in training with the off-the-shelf SVM solvers. Two novel metric learning models, namely positive-semi-definite constrained metric learning (PCML) and nonnegative-coefficient constrained metric learning (NCML), are developed. Both PCML and NCML can guarantee the global optimality of their solutions. Experiments are conducted on general classification, face verification, and person re-identification to evaluate our methods. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, our methods can achieve comparable classification accuracy and are efficient in training.

AB The Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor plays an important role in high voltage power transmission. However, due to non-linearities introduced by the protective equipment of the Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor, fault location in the series compensated line becomes a difficult task. The kernel extreme learning machine-based method for fault location in series compensated line is proposed in this article. Results of the kernel extreme learning machine are compared with other popular single-hidden layer feedforward network-based techniques, such as extreme learning machines, support vector machines, and relevance vector machines. Performances of these single-hidden layer feedforward networks are verified on two power systems: (1) Two-area equivalent system, and (2) 12-bus system modeled in detail. Simulation studies are performed with wide variation in system and fault parameters, such as compensation level, load conditions, fault resistance, fault location, and fault inception angle. The kernel extreme learning machine achieved better accuracy in lesser training time and parameter-tuning time.

Unfortunately, current protection measures such as firewalls, filters, and blacklists are not able to provide adequate protection of SS7. In this paper, a method for detection of SS7 attacks using machine learning is proposed. The paper clarifies the vulnerabilities of SS7 networks and explains how machine learning techniques can help improve SS7 security. A proof-of-concept SS7 protection system using machine learning is also described thoroughly.

AB This research presented a novel automatic flower classification system based on computer vision and machine learning techniques. First, we obtained in total 157 petal images of three alike categories using a digital camera. After pre-processing, we extracted color features and wavelet entropies from the petal images. Then, principle component analysis was utilized for feature reduction. Finally, four different classifiers, Support Vector Machine, Weighted k Nearest Neighbors, Kernel based Extreme Learning Machine, and Decision Tree, were trained to recognize the categories of the petals. 5-fold cross validation was employed to evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the classifiers. The experimental results showed that Weighted kNearest Neighbors performed the best among all four classifiers with an overall accuracy of 99.4%. The proposed approach is efficient in identifying flower categories in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Hydro-meteorological measures are one of the most challenging tasks of nature. Rainfall has become the most significant and technical factor for scheduling and functional criteria of any irrigation program with profound effects on agribusiness based economy for any region. It is vital important to accurately estimate rainfall and has been remained a great challenge. To estimate medium range monthly summer monsoon rainfall, machine learning models were developed using thirteen rain-gauges' long-term-average rainfall values of Jaipur city. The different input combinations of rain-gauges having 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and all-input parameters were explored using rainfall values of rain-gauge stations of Viratnagar, Bassi, Chaksu, Chomu, Jaipur, Dudu, Jamuna_Ramgarh, Kotputli, Phagi, Phulera, Amber, Sanganer, Shapura in Jaipur city. Exploring various empirical and dynamic machine learning approaches on rainfall data of 54 years period [1961-2015], rain-gauge station-wise were computed to evaluate the best rain-gauge station of Jaipur city with selection of best model for medium range estimation of monthly summer monsoon rainfall of Jaipur city. In the course of escalated experimentation, it is observed that Linear Regression outperforms over rest of other machine learning techniques and Amber rain-gauge station is the best rain-gauge among all used stations.

ID REGRESSION
AB In this study, a new approach is proposed for fault estimation in high voltage direct current transmission lines using discrete wavelet transform and extreme learning machine. Recently, signal processing and intelligent systems have gained importance to ease very different tasks such as fault location and estimation, load estimations, reactive power compensation, the risk of blackouts. Therefore, a fast, accurate and reliable protection algorithms have a major interest in the extended usage of high voltage direct current systems for many areas. In this study, single phase-ground faults on DC lines examined and a new machine learning approach also discussed. The virtual faults obtained from Matlab simulation is utilized in the course of feature extraction of the wavelet transform. Furthermore, for identifying steady state and faulted condition, Shannon entropy and signal's energy values have been calculated by using coefficients of the wavelet transform. After that, the coefficients normalized between [-1,1]. Finally, the extreme learning machine used to fault estimation and location process.

AB It is difficult for most object detection systems to deal with the nonrigid objects since the descriptions of these objects are diverse. This paper proposes a new vision-based head detection method by using extreme learning machine (ELM). ELM is an efficient learning algorithm for generalized single hidden layer feedforward networks. This proposed method employs the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) as features to describe the head objects. In order to improve the accuracy, HSV color features are also included. This proposed method is tested on PASCAL datasets. Experimental results have demonstrated the detection performance and efficiency of this proposed ELM-based head detection method.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Neural network (NN) and Case-based reasoning (CBR) have common advantages over other learning strategies. NN and CBR can be directly applied to the classification and regression problem without additional transform mechanisms. However, they all have disadvantages. The knowledge representation of NN is unreadable and this 'black box' property restricts the application of NN to areas which needs proper explanations. Meanwhile CBR suffers from the feature-weighting problem, when CBR measures the distance between cases, some input features should be treated more importantly than others. This paper, we propose a hybrid prediction system of extreme learning machine (ELM) and Case-based reasoning (ELM-CBR). In our hybrid system, the feature weight set calculated from the trained ELM network plays the core role in connecting both the learning strategies, and the explanation on prediction can be given by presenting the most similar cases from the case base. Moreover, the prediction value of the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine also utilized in conjunction with the neighborhood information. This provides extended information for the query with most similar cases in the database. Finally, we present an application in the sugarcane juice clarification, experiments show that the hybrid system has a better recognition rate compared the k-NN and GA-CBR method.

DE House Price Predction; Machine Learning; Classification
AB The phenomenon of the falling or rising of the house prices has attracted interest from the researcher as well as many other interested parties. There have been many previous research works that used various regression techniques to address the question of the changes house price. This work considers the issue of changing house price as a classification problem and applies machine learning techniques to predict whether house prices will rise or fall. This work applies various feature selection techniques such as variance influence factor, Information value, principle component analysis and data transformation techniques such as outlier and missing value treatment as well as box-cox transformation techniques. The performance of the machine learning techniques is measured by the four parameters of accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity. The work considers two discrete values 0 and 1 as respective classes. If the value of the class is 0 then we consider that the price of the house has decreased and if the value of the class is 1 then we consider that the price of the house has increased.

AB Fuzzing consists of repeatedly testing an application with modified, or fuzzed, inputs with the goal of finding security vulnerabilities in input-parsing code. In this paper, we show how to automate the generation of an input grammar suitable for input fuzzing using sample inputs and neural-network-based statistical machine-learning techniques. We present a detailed case study with a complex input format, namely PDF, and a large complex security-critical parser for this format, namely, the PDF parser embedded in Microsoft's new Edge browser. We discuss and measure the tension between conflicting learning and fuzzing goals: learning wants to capture the structure of well-formed inputs, while fuzzing wants to break that structure in order to cover unexpected code paths and find bugs. We also present a new algorithm for this learn& fuzz challenge which uses a learnt input probability distribution to intelligently guide where to fuzz inputs.

AB Asthma is not a single disease, but an umbrella term for a number of distinct diseases, each of which are caused by a distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanism. These discrete disease entities are often labelled as 'asthma endotypes'. The discovery of different asthma subtypes has moved from subjective approaches in which putative phenotypes are assigned by experts to data-driven ones which incorporate machine learning. This review focuses on the methodological developments of one such machine learning technique-latent class analysis-and how it has contributed to distinguishing asthma and wheezing subtypes in childhood. It also gives a clinical perspective, presenting the findings of studies from the past 5 years that used this approach. The identification of true asthma endotypes may be a crucial step towards understanding their distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, which could ultimately lead to more precise prevention strategies, identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of effective personalized therapies.

AB In this paper, to address the transfer learning problem in big data fields, a self labeling online sequential extreme learning machine is presented, which is called SLOSELM. Firstly, an ELM classifier is trained on the labeled training data set of the source domain. Secondly, the unlabeled data set of the target domain is classified by the ELM classifier. In the third step, the high confident samples are selected and the OSELM is employed to update the original ELM classifier. Tested on the real-world daily activity data set, the results show that our algorithm performs well and can achieve 75% accuracy, which is about 10% higher than the traditional ELM itself.

AB A multi-graph is represented by a bag of graphs and modeled as a generalization of a multi-instance. Multi-graph classification is a supervised learning problem, which has a wide range of applications, such as scientific publication categorization, bio-pharmaceutical activity tests and online product recommendation. However, existing algorithms are limited to process small datasets due to high computation complexity of multi-graph classification. Specially, the precision is not high enough for a large dataset. In this paper, we propose a scalable and high-precision parallel algorithm to handle the multi-graph classification problem on massive datasets using MapReduce and extreme learning machine. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic graph datasets show that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for road marking detection and classification based on machine learning algorithms. Road marking recognition is an important feature of an intelligent transportation system (ITS). Previous works are mostly developed using image processing and decisions are often made using empirical functions, which makes it difficult to be generalized. Hereby, we propose a general framework for object detection and classification, aimed at video-based intelligent transportation applications. It is a two-step approach. The detection is carried out using binarized normed gradient (BING) method. PCA network (PCANet) is employed for object classification. Both BING and PCANet are among the latest algorithms in the field of machine learning. Practically the proposed method is applied to a road marking dataset with 1,443 road images. We randomly choose 60% images for training and use the remaining 40% images for testing. Upon training, the system can detect 9 classes of road markings with an accuracy better than 96.8%. The proposed approach is readily applicable to other ITS applications.

AB Due to the increasing amount of sensors integrated into the environment and worn by the user, a sheer amount of context-sensitive data become available. While interpreting them with traditional methods (e.g., formulas and simple heuristics) is challenging, the latest machine learning techniques require only a set of labeled data. TensorFlow is an open-source library for machine learning which implements a wide range of neural network models. With TensorFlow Mobile, researchers and developers can further deploy the trained models on low-end mobile devices for ubiquitous scenarios. This facilitates the model export and offers techniques to optimize the model for a mobile deployment. In this tutorial, we teach attendees two basic steps to a deployment of neural networks on smartphones: Firstly, we will teach how to develop neural network architectures and train them in TensorFlow. Secondly, we show the process to run the trained models on a mobile phone using TensorFlow Mobile.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been proved to be exceptionally fast and achieves more generalized performance for learning Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Neural networks (SLFN). In this paper, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed to choose the appropriate initial weights, biases and the number of hidden neurons which minimizes the classification error. The proposed GA incorporates a novel elitism approach to avoid local optimum and also speed up GA to satisfy the multi-modal function. The experimental results indicate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with lower classification error.

AB In this paper, we describe an approximate method for reducing the time and memory complexities of the kernel Extreme Learning Machine variants. We show that, by adopting a Nystrom-based kernel ELM matrix approximation, we can define an ELM space exploiting properties of the kernel ELM space that can be subsequently used to apply several optimization schemes proposed in the literature for ELM network training. The resulted ELM network can achieve good performance, which is comparable to that of its standard kernel ELM counterpart, while overcoming the time and memory restrictions on kernel ELM algorithms that render their application in large-scale learning problems prohibitive.

   Gram-Schmidt process
ID FEEDFORWARD NEURAL-NETWORKS; HIDDEN NODES; ALGORITHM; SCHEME
AB To compact the architecture of extreme learning machine (ELM), two incremental learning algorithms are proposed in this paper. The previous incremental learning algorithms for ELM recruit hidden nodes randomly, which is equivalent to implementing a random selection from a candidate set of infinite size. Hence, it is impossible to recruit good hidden nodes, and thus it usually requires more hidden nodes than traditional neural networks to achieve matched performance. To improve the quality of the hidden nodes recruited, an incremental learning algorithm for ELM is presented based on Gram Schmidt process (GSI-ELM), which recruits the best hidden node from a random subset of fixed size via defining an evaluating criterion at each learning step. However, the "nesting effect" exists in the GSI-ELM, that is to say, the hidden nodes once recruited by GSI-ELM can not be later discarded. To treat this "nesting problem", the improved GSI-ELM (IGSI-ELM) is generated with an elimination mechanism. At each learning step IGSI-ELM eliminates the worst hidden node from the already-recruited group if it is not the newly-recruited one. Finally, to verify the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed algorithms, i.e. GSI-ELM and IGSI-ELM, in this paper, experiments on regression and classification benchmark data sets are investigated.

AB In recent years, the use of machine learning methods to deal with the problem of user interest prediction has become a hot research direction in the field of electronic commerce. In the present stage, a naive Bayesian algorithm has the advantages of simple implementation and high classification efficiency. However, this method is too dependent on the distribution of samples in the sample space, and has the potential of instability. To this end, the decision tree method is introduced to deal with the problem of interest classification, and the innovative use of Localstorage technology in HTML5 to obtain the required the experimental data. Classification method uses the information entropy of the training data set to build the classification model, through the simple search of the classification model to complete the classification of unknown data items. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the decision tree is used to deal with the problem of prediction of users' interests has obvious advantages in the efficiency and stability.

AB In today's large-scaled distributed learning, it often involves a large number of machines. Coordination between them can be very complicated. In order to emphasize the importance of the organic relationships between machines, we introduce the organization theories of human society, such as cooperation and competition, to machine learning. We design two type of multi-agents along with their interaction rules, and then perform the simulation on Swarm platform. The dynamic processes of the simulated team machine learning are examined and the results show that, by elaborately designed interaction rules, the overall performance of team learning can be promoted dramatically and coordination structure of the machines can be optimized.

DE multimodal data; interactive machine learning; online repositories
AB Interaction designers often use machine learning tools to generate intuitive mappings between complex inputs and outputs. These tools are usually trained live, which is not always feasible or practical. We combine RepoVizz, an online repository and visualizer for multimodal data, with a suite of Interactive Machine Learning tools, to demonstrate a technical solution for prototyping multimodal interactions that decouples the data acquisition step from the model training step. This way, different input data set-ups can be easily replicated, shared and experimented upon their capability to control complex output without the need to repeat the technical set-up.

ID MODE-LOCKED LASERS; FIBER LASERS; LOCKING
AB The integration of data-driven machine learning strategies with adaptive control are capable of producing efficient and optimal self-tuning algorithms for nonlinear optical systems. We demonstrate the concept on the specific case of an optical fiber laser cavity where the adaptive, multi parameter extremum-seeking control algorithm obtains and maintains high-energy, single-pulse states. The machine learning algorithm, which is based upon a physically realizable objective function that divides the energy output by the fourth moment of the pulse spectrum, characterizes the cavity itself for rapid state identification and improved optimization. The theory developed is demonstrated on a nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) based laser using waveplate and polarizer angles to achieve optimal passive mode-locking despite large disturbances to the system. The objective function peaks are high-energy mode-locked states that have a safety margin near parameter regimes where mode-locking breaks down or the multi-pulsing instability occurs. The methods demonstrated can be implemented broadly to optical systems, or more generally to any self-tuning complex.

AB Insufficient localization accuracy of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers is one of the challenges to implement advanced intelligent transportation system in highly urbanized areas. Multipath and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) effects strongly deteriorate GNSS positioning performance. This paper aims to train a classifier by supervised machine learning to separate the type of GNSS pseudorange measurement into three categories, clean, multipath and NLOS. Several features obtained or calculated from the GNSS raw data are evaluated. This paper also proposes a new feature to indicate the consistency between measurements of pseudorange and Doppler shift. According to the experiment result, about 75% of classification accuracy can be achieved using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained by the proposed feature and received signal strength.

AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) concept provides some effective training algorithms to construct single hidden layer feedforward networks (SHLFNs). However, the conventional ELM algorithms were designed for the noiseless situation only, in which the outputs of the hidden nodes are not contaminated by noise. This paper presents two noise-resistant training algorithms, namely noise-resistant incremental ELM (NRI-ELM) and noise-resistant convex incremental ELM (NRCI-ELM). For NRI-ELM, its noise-resistant ability is better than that of the conventional incremented ELM algorithms. To further enhance the noise resistant ability, the NRCI-ELM algorithm is proposed. The convergent properties of the two proposed noise resistant algorithms are also presented.

AB of user-generated data on social media platforms like Twitter, several opportunities and new open doors have been prompted for organizations that endeavour hard to keep a track on customer reviews and opinions about their products. Twitter is a huge fast emergent micro-blogging social networking platform for users to express their views about politics, products sports etc. These views are useful for businesses, government and individuals. Hence, tweets can be used as a valuable source for mining public's opinion. Sentiment analysis is a process of automatically identifying whether a user-generated text expresses positive, negative or neutral opinion about an entity (i.e. product, people, topic, event etc). The objective of this paper is to give step-by-step detail about the process of sentiment analysis on twitter data using machine learning. This paper also provides details of proposed approach for sentiment analysis. This work proposes a Text analysis framework for twitter data using Apache spark and hence is more flexible, fast and scalable. Naive Bayes and Decision trees machine learning algorithms are used for sentiment analysis in the proposed framework.

For some of these designs the simulation can fail for an unknown reason, which in turn may hamper the optimization process. To handle such scenarios more effectively, this study proposes the integration of classifiers, borrowed from the domain of machine learning, into the optimization process. Several implementations of the proposed approach are described. An extensive set of numerical experiments shows that the proposed approach improves search effectiveness.

AB The large amounts of data used nowadays have motivated research and development in different disciplines in order to extract useful information with a view to analyzing it to solve difficult problems. Data mining and machine learning are two computing disciplines that enable analysis of huge data sets in an automated manner. In this paper, we give an overview of several applications using these disciplines in education, particularly those that use some of the most successful methods in the machine learning community, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, Bayesian learning and instance-based methods. Although these two areas of artificial intelligence have been applied in many real-world problems in different fields, such as astronomy, medicine, and robotics, their application in education is relatively new. The search was performed mainly on databases such as EBSCO, Elsevier, Google Scholar, IEEEXplore and ACM. We hope to provide a useful resource for the education community by presenting this review of approaches.

AB Background: There are no objective, biological markers that can robustly predict methylphenidate response in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This study aimed to examine whether applying machine learning approaches to pretreatment demographic, clinical questionnaire, environmental, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and genetic information can predict therapeutic response following methylphenidate administration.
   Methods: The present study included 83 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder youth. At baseline, parents completed the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and Disruptive Behavior Disorder rating scale, and participants undertook the continuous performance test, Stroop color word test, and resting-state functional MRI scans. The dopamine transporter gene, dopamine D4 receptor gene, alpha-2A adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2A) and norepinephrine transporter gene polymorphisms, and blood lead and urine cotinine levels were also measured. The participants were enrolled in an 8-week, open-label trial of methylphenidate. Four different machine learning algorithms were used for data analysis.
   Results: Support vector machine classification accuracy was 84.6% (area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.84) for predicting methylphenidate response. The age, weight, ADRA2A MspI and DraI polymorphisms, lead level, Stroop color word test performance, and oppositional symptoms of Disruptive Behavior Disorder rating scale were identified as the most differentiating subset of features.
   Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary support to the translational development of support vector machine as an informative method that can assist in predicting treatment response in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, though further work is required to provide enhanced levels of classification performance.

AB This paper is a rethinking of the conventional method of moments (MoM) using the modern machine learning (ML) technology. By repositioning the MoM matrix and unknowns in an artificial neural network (ANN), the conventional linear algebra MoM solving is changed into a machine learning training process. The trained result is the solution. As an application, the parasitic capacitance extraction broadly needed by VLSI modeling is solved through the proposed new machine learning based method of moments (ML-MoM). The multiple linear regression (MLR) is employed to train the model. The computations are done on Amazon Web Service (AWS). Benchmarks demonstrated the interesting feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach. According to our knowledge, this is the first MoM truly powered by machine learning methods. It opens enormous software and hardware resources for MoM and related algorithms that can be applied to signal integrity and power integrity simulations.

ID REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION
AB Feature learning is an initial step applied to computer vision tasks and is broadly categorized as: 1) deep feature learning; 2) shallow feature learning. In this paper we focus on shallow feature learning as these algorithms require less computational resources than deep feature learning algorithms. In this paper we propose a shallow feature learning algorithm referred to as Extreme Learning Machine Network (ELMNet). ELMNet is module based neural network consist of feature learning module and a post-processing module. Each feature learning module in ELMNet performs the following operations: 1) patch-based mean removal; 2) ELM auto-encoder (ELM-AE) to learn features. Post-processing module is inserted after the feature learning module and simplifies the features learn by the feature learning modules by hashing and block-wise histogram. Proposed ELMNet outperforms shallow feature learning algorithm PCANet on the MNIST hand-written dataset.

AB The PID control algorithm is the most used industrial control method owing to its simplicity and ease of use. However, tuning PID parameters is not trivial and many methods have been reported in literature. This paper seeks to show a machine learning approach using multivariate regression with gradient descent and the normal equation. The first order cruise control system is used as an example and results show good progress towards automatic PID tuning using learned data.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is of great interest to the machine learning society due to its extremely simple training step. Its performance sensitivity to the number of hidden neurons is studied under the context of hyperspectral remote sensing image classification. An empirical linear relationship between the number of training samples and the number of hidden neurons is proposed. Such a relationship can be easily estimated with two small training sets and extended to large training sets to greatly reduce computational cost. The kernel version of ELM (KELM) is also implemented with the radial basis function kernel, and such a linear relationship is still suitable. The experimental results demonstrated that when the number of hidden neurons is appropriate, the performance of ELM may be slightly lower than the linear SVM, but the performance of KELM can be comparable to the kernel version of SVM (KSVM). The computational cost of ELM and KELM is much lower than that of the linear SVM and KSVM, respectively. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

Using custom wearable devices with localized sound, our observations demonstrate how sonification enables the communication of time-based information about movements such as phrase length and periodicity, and nuanced information such as magnitudes and accelerations. The work raises a number challenges regarding the application of IML to this domain. In particular we identify a need for ensuring even rates of change in regression models when performing sonification and a need for consideration of how to convey machine learning approaches to end users.

AB As for the huge gap between the low-level image features and high-level semantics, content-based image retrieval still could not receive a satisfying result by now. Since the special request of the relevance feedback, making full use of the rare number of labeled data and numerous unlabeled data is an ideal way. Because ELM has excellent classification accuracy and processing time, and high accuracy and fast speed are the key factors to evaluate the relevance feedback performances. In this paper, we proposed an Extreme learning Machine with Gaussian kernel Based Relevance Feedback scheme for image retrieval, to overcome the above limitations, our method uses three component classifiers to form a strong learner by learning different features extracted from the hand-marking data, then we use it to label the image database automatically. From the experiments we can see the use of the ELM with kernel have high classification accuracy, the processing time get largely decreased at the same time. Thus, it improves the efficiency of entire relevance feedback system. The experiments results show that the proposed algorithm is significantly effective.

AB As electric signals are transmitted between the brain cells for transferring of data within the brain, capturing of these signals can result in understanding the functionality of brain and other directly linked parts (like eyes, ears, spinal nerves etc) of our body. We can also capture epileptic seizures that are caused by a disruption in the working of brain, by the Electro Encephalogram Test. These electric signals are to be captured by small electrodes placed on human scalp using a standard 10/20 system on an Electro Encephalograph monitor. In this work, we will predict the state of eye (open or closed) by exploring 13 machine learning models on a 15 features dataset of an EEG test. The records of 14 electrodes are used for this prediction. Results are evaluated using 6 different machine learning parameters i.e. Sensitivity, Confusion matrix, Kappa value, Specificity, Accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. K-fold validation and ensembling of models will be done on best three predictive models pertaining to our dataset.

AB Data streams from various Internet-Of-Things (IOT) enabled sensors in smart homes provide an opportunity to develop predictive models to offer actionable insights in form of preventive care to its residence. This becomes particularly relevant for Aging-In-Place (AIP) solutions for the care of the elderly. Over the last decade, diverse stakeholders from practice, industry, education, research, and professional organizations have collaborated to furnish homes with a variety of IOT enabled sensors to record daily activities of individuals. Machine Learning on such streams allows for detection of patterns and prediction of activities which enables preventive care. Behavior patterns that lead to preventive care constitute a series of activities. Accurate labeling of activities is an extremely time-consuming process and the resulting labels are often noisy and error prone. In this paper, we analyze the classification accuracy of various activities within a home using machine learning models. We present that the use of an ensemble model that combines multiple learning models allows to obtain better classification of activities than any of the constituent learning algorithms.

AB This study explores the application of artificial intelligence on the causal relationship between mining production index and electricity load. The data used is the total mining production index and total electricity consumption in the mining sector sampled on a monthly basis from January 1985 to December 2011 in South Africa. Optimally-pruned and basic extreme learning machines were used to develop nonlinear models on the datasets under consideration. This work introduces the use of extreme learning machines for modeling. It was found that, using OP-ELM, there is statistically significant improvement in forecasting error of the electricity load by using both the mining production index and the electricity load on the conditioning set and the same set showed no improvement in predicting the production index. ELM results showed no improvement for both electricity load and production index. It was concluded that the OP-ELM models showed a unidirectional granger causal relationship running from the mining production to electricity load.

AB The future Internet is expected to connect billions of people, things and services having the potential to deliver a new set of applications by deriving new insights from the data generated from these diverse data sources. This highly interconnected global network brings new types of challenges in analysing and making sense of data. This is why machine learning is expected to be a crucial technology in the future, in making sense of data, in improving business and decision making, and in doing so, providing the potential to solve a wide range of problems in health care, telecommunications, urban computing, and others. Machine learning algorithms can learn how to perform certain tasks by generalizing examples from a range of sampling. This is a totally different paradigm than traditional programming language approaches, which are based on writing programs that process data to produce an output. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a particular application requires a substantial amount of time and effort that is hard to undertake even with excellent research papers and textbooks. In order to reduce the time and effort, this paper introduces the TCDC (train, compare, decide, and change) approach, which can be thought as a 'Machine Learning as a Service' approach, to aid machine learning researchers and practitioners to choose the optimum machine learning model to use for achieving the best trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, computational complexity, and ease of implementation. The paper includes the results of testing and evaluating the recommenders based on the TCDC approach (in comparison with the traditional default approach) applied to 12 datasets that are available as open-source datasets drawn from diverse domains including health care, agriculture, aerodynamics and others. Our results indicate that the proposed approach selects the best model in terms of predictive accuracy in 62.5 % for regression tests performed and 75 % for classification tests.

DE MANET; Machine Learning; Dynamic Topology
AB Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a new approach of communication as it has no any prior infrastructure requirement. The operability and fast deployment has enhanced its acceptability in this fast-growing environment of Internet. MANET also faces the problem of dynamic topology that change rapidly over time. This dynamic behavior is either caused by mobile node movement, environmental factors, battery failure and bandwidth problem. Due to this dynamic topology, the network performance highly degrade as reliability of packet delivery is reduce and resource utilization will be poor. To adapt to such conditions, several networks protocol were introduced to overcome such problem but less often researchers has utilized machine learning techniques to eliminate this problem. The learning also suggests solutions which can maximize the utilization of this Mobile Ad-hoc network. The mobile node established the connection with the help of special gateway called MANET Gateway. The discovery of these gateways could be done with the help of machine learning technique or soft computing technique. In this paper, we have illustrated a literature review of machine learning based gateway discovery approach. The pros and cons of all proposed methodologies are evaluated against the dynamic problem.

Pulmonary imaging, with chest radiography and computed tomography, has always been one of the focus areas in this field. In this study, I describe how machine learning became the dominant technology for tackling CAD in the lungs, generally producing better results than do classical rule-based approaches, and how the field is now rapidly changing: in the last few years, we have seen how even better results can be obtained with deep learning. The key differences among rule-based processing, machine learning, and deep learning are summarized and illustrated for various applications of CAD in the chest.

AB Real-time driver distraction detection is the core to many distraction countermeasures and fundamental for constructing a driver-centered driver assistance system. While data-driven methods demonstrate promising detection performance, a particular challenge is how to reduce the considerable cost for collecting labeled data. This paper explored semi-supervised methods for driver distraction detection in real driving conditions to alleviate the cost of labeling training data. Laplacian support vector machine and semi-supervised extreme learning machine were evaluated using eye and head movements to classify two driver states: attentive and cognitively distracted. With the additional unlabeled data, the semi-supervised learning methods improved the detection performance (G-mean) by 0.0245, on average, over all subjects, as compared with the traditional supervised methods. As unlabeled training data can be collected from drivers' naturalistic driving records with little extra resource, semi-supervised methods, which utilize both labeled and unlabeled data, can enhance the efficiency of model development in terms of time and cost.

AB Growth in electricity demand also gives a rise to the necessity of cheaper and safer electric supply and forecasting electricity load plays a key role in this goal. In this study recurrent extreme learning machine (RELM) was proposed as a novel approach to forecast electricity load more accurately. In RELM, extreme learning machine (ELM), which is a training method for single hidden layer feed forward neural network, was adapted to train a single hidden layer Jordan recurrent neural network. Electricity Load Diagrams 2011-2014 dataset was employed to evaluate and validate the proposed approach. Obtained results were compared with traditional ELM, linear regression, generalized regression neural network and some other popular machine learning methods. Achieved root mean square errors (RMSE) by RELM were nearly twice less than obtained results by other employed machine learning methods. The results showed that the recurrent type ANNs had extraordinary success in forecasting dynamic systems and also time-ordered datasets with comparison to feed forward ANNs. Also, used time in the training stage is similar to ELM and they are extremely fast than the others. This study showed that the proposed approach can be applied to forecast electricity load and RELM has high potential to be utilized in modeling dynamic systems effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Phishing website; machine learning; wrapper features selection
AB The problem of Web phishing attacks has grown considerably in recent years and phishing is considered as one of the most dangerous Web crimes, which may cause tremendous and negative effects on online business. In a Web phishing attack, the phisher creates a forged or phishing website to deceive Web users in order to obtain their sensitive financial and personal information. Several conventional techniques for detecting phishing website have been suggested to cope with this problem. However, detecting phishing websites is a challenging task, as most of these techniques are not able to make an accurate decision dynamically as to whether the new website is phishing or legitimate. This paper presents a methodology for phishing website detection based on machine learning classifiers with a wrapper features selection method. In this paper, some common supervised machine learning techniques are applied with effective and significant features selected using the wrapper features selection approach to accurately detect phishing websites. The experimental results demonstrated that the performance of the machine learning classifiers was improved by using the wrapper-based features selection. Moreover, the machine learning classifiers with the wrapper-based features selection outperformed the machine learning classifiers with other features selection methods.

AB Partial Discharge (PD) pattern analysis is widely used for condition assessment of generator stator winding insulation. The common PD sources of generator stator winding are slot discharge, end winding surface discharge, discharge at void in bulk insulation and discharge due to delamination on conductor surface and machine learning techniques are commonly used to discriminate them. This paper presents a comparison of different machine learning techniques to classify 352 Phase Resolved PD (PRPD) patterns obtained from a 37.5 MW, 12.5 kV generator. Ninety-six features representing each PRPD pattern were considered in this analysis. Based on the analysis, PRPD patterns were classified into different types of internal discharges. Nine different supervised machine learning algorithms under four different techniques i.e. functional based techniques, probabilistic techniques, decision tree models and nearest neighbor search were used. For the training process 70% of PRPD patterns were used whereas the remaining samples were used for the testing of the trained models. It was found that the accuracy is above 95% for most of the tested algorithms. It can be concluded that PDs in generator stator insulation can effectively be assessed by PD pattern classification through supervised machine learning techniques.

AB Infant's cry is an innate response to express several situations including pain, disturbance and discomfort. Therefore the automatic recognition of infant cries patterns is the key factor to develop successful ambient intelligence applications to enhance the quality of life of both infants and parents. This paper proposes a complete machine learning process including consistent dataset generation from infant cries and selecting appropriate sound features, with promising experimental results for enhancing the monitoring of infants in real world settings. The originality of the proposed approach lies in its ability to detect and analyze automatically discomfort signals, which recurrently affects 20 to 25% of newborns. The machine learning process includes low-level audio features selection methods from labeled infant pre-cry recordings as well as high-level features characterizing the envelop of the crying. The classification is performed using ensemble learning methods after a stage of features selection. The exploitation of pre-crying signals to improve the quality of the recognition is another important aspect of the proposed approach, which optimizes the accuracy of the learning step as it is shown by the obtained results on a real dataset. This result gives the opportunity to develop new baby monitors able to anticipate the infants needs.

AB Machine learning and geostatistics are powerful mathematical frameworks for modeling spatial data. Both approaches, however, suffer from poor scaling of the required computational resources for large data applications. We present the Stochastic Local Interaction (SLI) model, which employs a local representation to improve computational efficiency. SLI combines geostatistics and machine learning with ideas from statistical physics and computational geometry. It is based on a joint probability density function defined by an energy functional which involves local interactions implemented by means of kernel functions with adaptive local kernel bandwidths. SLI is expressed in terms of an explicit, typically sparse, precision (inverse covariance) matrix. This representation leads to a semi-analytical expression for interpolation (prediction), which is valid in any number of dimensions and avoids the computationally costly covariance matrix inversion.

AB Computational intelligence, fuzzy systems, and machine learning have become very popular in different academies around the globe, including mathematics, statistical, computer science, philosophy departments, etc. While a large body of academic research has been done in the last 50 years, industrial and real world applications are incipient when compared to the amount of people involved in academic research. Thus, there are many questions and complaints to be answered in order to apply all we (scientists) have done. To do so, we provide a short-comprehensive diagnosis of the current situation and provide some short term strategies to improve the link between industry applications of academic research.

AB In this paper, we propose a joint machine learning and human learning design approach to make the training data labeling task in linear regression problems more efficient and robust to noise, modeling mismatch, and human labeling errors. Considering a sequential active learning scheme which relies on human learning to enlarge training data set, we integrate it with sparse outlier detection algorithms to mitigate the inevitable human errors during training data labeling. First, we assume sparse human errors and formulate the outlier detection as a sparse optimization problem within the sequential active learning procedure. Then, for non-sparse human errors, with the IRT (item response theory) to model the distribution of human errors, appropriate data are selected to reconstruct a training data set with sparse human errors. Simulations are conducted to verify the desirable performance of the proposed approach.

AB Modern electricity grids continue to be vulnerable to large-scale blackouts. As all states leading to large-scale blackouts are unique, there is no algorithm to identify pre-emergency states. Moreover, numerical conventional methods are computationally expensive, which makes it difficult to use for the on-line security assessment. Machine learning techniques with their pattern recognition, learning capabilities and high speed of identifying the potential security boundaries can offer an alternative approach. The purpose of this paper is not to suggest that one particular kind of machine learning technique for security assessment would be more appropriate than others. We start from the premise that almost every method may be useful within some restricted context. Based on this idea, we developed an automated multi-model approach for on-line security assessment. The proposed method allows us to automatically test the different state-of-art techniques in order to find both the best algorithm and its top performance tuning for particular analyzed power system. A case study using the IEEE RTC-96 system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and use of therapeutic peptides to target and kill cancer cells has received considerable attention in recent years. Identification of anticancer peptides (ACPs) through wet-lab experimentation is expensive and often time consuming; therefore, development of an efficient computational method is essential to identify potential ACP candidates prior to in vitro experimentation. In this study, we developed support vector machine- and random forest-based machine-learning methods for the prediction of ACPs using the features calculated from the amino acid sequence, including amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, atomic composition, and physicochemical properties. We trained our methods using the Tyagi-B dataset and determined the machine parameters by 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of our methods on two benchmarking datasets, with our results showing that the random forest-based method outperformed the existing methods with an average accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient value of 88.7% and 0.78, respectively. To assist the scientific community, we also developed a publicly accessible web server at www.thegleelab.org/MLACP.html.

AB The application of machine learning and statistical predictive models to business problems has found success in recent years due to an exponential increase in consumer data and readily available computational power. However, visualising and interpreting this data to support business decision making in the context of consulting businesses is challenging and there is scope for advancement. The accurate prediction of hours to be spent on a project (cost) ahead of time underpins the profitability of these organisations. The aim of the research is twofold: to identify suitable techniques from the fields of machine learning and statistics for internal cost prediction in a consulting business, and to develop a user interface with visual analytics displaying results from these techniques to provide interactive decision support. The data for this project was collected from a consulting business' customer relationship management (CRM) database, which contained twelve years of past consulting projects. To date, statistical linear models and machine learning decision trees have been trialed and the research will progress into random forests, neural networks, and support vector machine (SVM) models. A prototype user interface and visualisation of the results has also been developed.

AB Rapeseed is widely cultivated throughout the world for the production of animal feed, vegetable fat for human consumption, and biodiesel. Since the seeds are evaluated in many areas for sowing and oilseed processing, they must be identified quickly and accurately for selection of a correct variety. An affordable method based on computer vision and machine learning was proposed to classify the seven rapeseed varieties. Different types of feature sets, feature models, and machine learning classifiers were investigated to obtain the best predictive model for rapeseed classification. The training and test sets were used to tune the model parameters during the training epochs by varying the complexity of the predictive models with grid-search and K-fold cross validation. After obtaining optimized models for each level of complexity, a dedicated validation set was used to validate predictive models. The developed computer vision system provided an overall accuracy rate of 99.24% for the best predictive model in discriminating rapeseed variety. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pornography on social media raises a lot of negative impact and affect the moral of children and teenagers. Social media used to spread pornography can have a negative impact. Thus, the spread of pornography on social media must be prevented. One of the social media which is often used as a medium pornography is Twitter. Pornography used on Twitter in the form of text and image. Among the two types of media, the text is very interesting to study because of the use of a variety of languages. In this study, the classification process will be conducted in Indonesian and English tweet and a combination of both languages. This classification uses three methods of machine learning, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines for the purpose of comparing which method is the best in the classification process. In this study also conducted additional experiment was carried out with the aim of improving the performance in classification. The results showed that the level of accuracy is quite high. However, different grammar is a constraint that affects the accuracy of the results in the classification. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop a user-friendly web application that follows human computer interaction design guidelines and principles and is used to recognize patterns in datasets and to predict outputs of instances that it hasn't previously encountered. The application design follows human computer interaction design guidelines and principles and it employs supervised machine learning algorithms linear regression, logistic regression, and backpropagation for prediction. Java is used in the backend to create a model that maps the input and output data based on any of the machine learning algorithms while Play Framework and Bootstrap are used to display content in frontend. The application allows users to upload datasets that will be used to train and test the system. Each column of an uploaded dataset represents an attribute and each row represents an instance. The system is also developer friendly and allows changes be made to the source code for a more customized interaction.

AB Big data is an emerging field with different datasets of various sizes are being analyzed for potential applications. In parallel, many frameworks are being introduced where these datasets can be fed into machine learning algorithms. Though some experiments have been done to compare different machine learning algorithms on different data, these experiments have not been tested out on different platforms. Our research aims to compare two selected machine learning algorithms on data sets of different sizes deployed on different platforms like Weka, Scikit-Learn and Apache Spark. They are evaluated based on Training time, Accuracy and Root mean squared error. This comparison helps us to decide what platform is best suited to work while applying computationally expensive selected machine learning algorithms on a particular size of data. Experiments suggested that Scikit-Learn would be optimal on data which can fit into memory. While working with huge, data Apache Spark would be optimal as it performs parallel computations by distributing the data over a cluster. Hence this study concludes that spark platform which has growing support for parallel implementation of machine learning algorithms could be optimal to analyze big data.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a massive group of devices containing sensors or actuators connected together over wired or wireless networks. With an estimate of over 25 billion devices connected together by 2020, IoT has been rapidly growing over the past decade. During the growth, security has been identified as one of the weakest areas in IoT. When implementing security within an IoT network, there are several challenges including heterogeneity within the system as well as the quantity of devices that need to be addressed.
   To approach the challenges in securing IoT devices, we propose using machine learning within an IoT gateway to help secure the system. We investigate using Artificial Neural Networks in a gateway to detect anomalies in the data sent from the edge devices. We are convinced that this approach can improve the security of IoT systems.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) offers the ability to analyze and predict our surroundings through sensor networks at the network edge. To facilitate this predictive functionality, Edge Computing (EC) applications are developed by considering: power consumption, network lifetime and quality of context inference. Humongous contextual data from sensors provide data scientists better knowledge extraction, albeit coming at the expense of holistic data transfer that threatens the network feasibility and lifetime. To cope with this, collaborative machine learning is applied to EC devices to (i) extract the statistical relationships and (ii) construct regression (predictive) models to maximize communication efficiency. In this paper, we propose a learning methodology that improves the prediction accuracy by quantizing the input space and leveraging the local knowledge of the EC devices.

AB Class imbalance in machine learning is when there are significantly fewer training instances of one class in comparison to another one. In bioinformatics, there is such a problem in the computational prediction of novel microRNA (miRNAs) within a full genome. The well-known precursors miRNA (pre-miRNA) are usually only a few in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of potential candidates, which makes this task a high class imbalance classification problem. It is well-known that high class imbalance usually affects any classical supervised machine learning classifier. Thus the imbalance must be explicitly considered. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a supervised artificial neural network model that has gained interest in the last years because of its high learning rate and performance. In this work, we propose a novel approach to overcome the high class imbalance in pre-miRNAs prediction data in which ELMs are used for predicting good candidates to pre-miRNA, without needing balanced data sets. Real datasets were used for validation of the proposal with several class imbalance levels. The results obtained showed the superiority of the ELM approach against very recent state-of-the-art methods in the same experimental conditions.

DE reverse engineering; machine learning; function recognition
AB Function recognition in program binaries serves as the foundation for many binary instrumentation and analysis tasks. However, as binaries are usually stripped before distribution, function information is indeed absent in most binaries. By far, identifying functions in stripped binaries remains a challenge. Recent research work proposes to recognize functions in binary code through machine learning techniques. The recognition model, including typical function entry point patterns, is automatically constructed through learning. However, we observed that as previous work only leverages syntax-level features to train the model, binary obfuscation techniques can undermine the prelearned models in real-world usage scenarios. In this paper, we propose FID, a semantics-based method to recognize functions in stripped binaries. We leverage symbolic execution to generate semantic information and learn the function recognition model through well-performing machine learning techniques.
   FID extracts semantic information from binary code and, therefore, is effectively adapted to different compilers and optimizations. Moreover, we also demonstrate that FID has high recognition accuracy on binaries transformed by widely-used obfuscation techniques. We evaluate FID with over four thousand test cases. Our evaluation shows that FID is comparable with previous work on normal binaries and it notably outperforms existing tools on obfuscated code.

AB Learning rich representations efficiently plays an important role in multi-modal recognition task, which is crucial to achieve high generalization performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an effective Multi-Modal Local Receptive Field Extreme Learning Machine (MM-ELM-LRF) structure, while maintaining ELM's advantages of training efficiency. In this structure, ELM-LRF is firstly conducted for feature extraction for each modality separately. And then, the shared layer is developed by combining these features from each modality. Finally, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used as supervised feature classifier for the final decision. Experimental validation on Washington RGB-D Object Dataset illustrates that the proposed multiple modality fusion method achieves better recognition performance.

AB In this paper, a new sequential learning algorithm is constructed by combining the Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) and Kalman filter regression. The Kalman Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (KOSELM) handles the problem of multicollinearity of the OS-ELM, which can generate poor predictions and unstable models. The KOSELM learns the training data one-by-one or chunk-by-chunk by adjusting the variance of the output weights through the Kalman filter. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been validated on benchmark regression datasets, and the results show that KOSELM can achieve a higher learning accuracy than OS-ELM and its related extensions. A statistical validation for the differences of the accuracy for all algorithms is performed, and the results confirm that KOSELM has better stability than ReOS-ELM, TOSELM and LS-IELM.

DE Wikipedia; vandalism; machine learning
AB Applying machine learning algorithms for detecting vandalism in two languages are described in this paper. Vandalism is a major issue in Wikipedia as it accounts for about 1% of edits during 2015. The majority of vandalism is from human editors, whose vandalism can be traced through access and edit logs. In this paper, we propose using a list of classifiers in one language, and then evaluate them across languages in two datasets: the hourly count of views of each Wikipedia article, and the used edit history of articles. For this purpose, Simple English and Albanian Wikipedia datasets will be used. The results obtained show that the characteristic features of vandalism can be learned from view and edit patterns, and models built in one language can be applied successfully to other languages.

AB Machine learning classifiers help physicians to make near-perfect diagnoses, minimizing costs and time. Since medical data usually contains a high degree of uncertainty and ambiguity, proper ordering and classification require a proper comparative performance analysis of machine learning classifiers. Machine learning classifiers are applied on the Ovarian Cancer Dataset. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women, and is the deadliest of gynecological cancers. The mortality rate of ovarian cancer ranks first. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are critical for improving the patients' cure rate and prolonging their survival. Here we have investigated Mass spectrometry (MS) field data to develop a computer-aided system for the purpose. Using machine learning techniques, data is classified in different categories to identify benign and malignant cancerous cells and a comparative study has been done to identify the most suitable technique under different operational conditions and datasets. Our Comparative studies show that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is the best options for such detection considering its performance metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity and Errors.

AB Learning effect is a phenomenon in industrial processes that a machine (plant, worker, etc) can improve its productivity continuously with time, that is the actual processing time of a job decreases after the machine (plant, worker, etc) processes other jobs and gains some experiences. We study single machine scheduling problems with sum-of-processing-time based and job-dependent learning effect. The objectives are to minimize the maximum lateness, the number of tardy jobs, and total weighted completion time. By performing reductions from equal cardinality partition problem, we prove that these problems under investigation are all NP-hard. Two special cases that can be solved in polynomial time are also presented.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a fast algorithm to train single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). Like the traditional classification algorithms, such as decision tree, Naive Bayes classifier and support vector machine, ELM also tends to provide biased classification results when the classification tasks are imbalanced. In this article, we first analyze the relationship between ELM and Naive Bayes classifier, and then take the decision outputs of all training instances in ELM as probability density representation by kernel probability density estimation method. Finally, the optimal classification hyperplane can be determined by finding the intersection point of two probability density distribution curves. Experimental results on thirty-two imbalanced data sets indicate that the proposed algorithm can address class imbalance problem effectively, as well outperform some existing class imbalance learning algorithms in the context of ELM.

AB In this paper, an improved multiple kernel extreme learning machine is proposed for multivariate time series prediction. The time series is first phase-space reconstructed to form the input and output samples and then an ensemble of multiple kernel extreme learning machine is proposed based on AdaBoost.RT to achieve an improved model. In the process of model training, the weights of the training samples are adjusted according to their training error and the training samples with greater error would obtain heavier weights and be focused on to be learned. The final proposed model is a weighted ensemble of the multiple kernel extreme learning machine. The experimental results of Lorenz chaotic multivariate dynamic system and the annual runoff and sunspot multivariate dynamic system demonstrate that the proposed model has better prediction performance.

AB Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) processes are commonly deployed in manufacturing of lightweight structures made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer. In general, AFP is connected to individual manufacturing knowledge during process planning and time consuming manual quality inspections. In both cases, automatic solutions provide a high economic potential. Therefore, a machine learning approach for planning, optimizing and inspection of AFP processes is presented. Process data from planning, CNC and online process monitoring is aggregated for the documentation of the part specific manufacturing history and the automated generation of manufacturing knowledge. Within this approach a complete automation of data capturing, data storing, modeling and optimizing is achieved. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In order to improve the accuracy and reduce the training and testing time in image classification algorithm, a novel image classification scheme based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and linear spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding (ScSPM) for image classification is proposed. A new structure based on two layer extreme learning machine instead of the original linear SVM classifier is constructed. Firstly, the ScSPM algorithm is performed to extract features of the multi-scale image blocks, and then each layer feature vector is connected to an ELM. Finally, the mapping features are connected together, and as the input of one ELM based on radial basis kernel function. With experimental evaluations on the well-known dataset benchmarks, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better performance not only in reducing the training time, but also in improving the accuracy of classification.

AB Rule-and model-based methods of etch proximity correction (EPC) are widely used, but they are insufficiently accurate for technologies below 20 nm. Simple rules are no longer adequate for the complicated patterns in layouts; and models based on a few empirically determined parameters cannot reflect etching phenomena physically. We introduce machine learning to EPC: each segment of interest, together with its surroundings, is characterized by geometric and optical parameters, which are then submitted to an artificial neural network that predicts the etch bias. We have implemented this new approach to EPC using a commercial OPC tool, and applied it to a DRAM gate layer in 20-nm technology, achieving predictions that are 34% more accurate than model-based EPC.

AB A critical problem in mapping data is the frequent updating of large data sets. To solve this problem, the updating of small-scale data based on large-scale data is very effective. Various map generalization techniques, such as simplification, displacement, typification, elimination, and aggregation, must therefore be applied. In this study, we focused on the elimination and aggregation of the building layer, for which each building in a large scale was classified as 0-eliminated, 1-retained, or 2-aggregated. Machine-learning classification algorithms were then used for classifying the buildings. The data of 1:1000 scale and 1:25,000 scale digital maps obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute were used. We applied to these data various machine-learning classification algorithms, including naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM). The overall accuracies of each algorithm were satisfactory: DT, 88.96%; k-NN, 88.27%; SVM, 87.57%; and NB, 79.50%. Although elimination is a direct part of the proposed process, generalization operations, such as simplification and aggregation of polygons, must still be performed for buildings classified as retained and aggregated. Thus, these algorithms can be used for building classification and can serve as preparatory steps for building generalization.

AB In this paper, the recently proposed extreme learning machine in the aspect of optimization method by Huang et al. (Neurocomputing, 74: 155-163, 2010) has been considered in its primal form whose solution is obtained by solving an absolute value equation problem by a simple, functional iterative algorithm. It has been proved under sufficient conditions that the algorithm converges linearly. The pseudo codes of the algorithm for regression and classification are given and they can be easily implemented in MATLAB. Experiments were performed on a number of real-world datasets using additive and radial basis function hidden nodes. Similar or better generalization performance of the proposed method in comparison to support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) and optimization based extreme learning machine (OB-ELM) methods with faster learning speed than SVM and OB-ELM demonstrates its effectiveness and usefulness.

AB Big Data has been a catalyst force for the Machine Learning (ML) area, forcing us to rethink existing strategies in order to create innovative solutions that will push forward the field. This paper presents an overview of the strategies for using machine learning in Big Data with emphasis on the high-performance parallel implementations on many-core hardware. The rationale is to increase the practical applicability of ML implementations to large-scale data problems. The common underlying thread has been the recent progress in usability, cost effectiveness and diversity of parallel computing platforms, specifically, the Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), tailored for a broad set of data analysis and Machine Learning tasks. In this context, we provide the main outcomes of a GPU Machine Learning Library (GPUMLib) framework, which empowers researchers with the capacity to tackle larger and more complex problems, by using high-performance implementations of well-known ML algorithms. Moreover, we attempt to give insights on the future trends of Big Data Analytics and the challenges lying ahead.

Through interpreting the antenna selection (AS) in wireless communications (i.e., an optimization-driven decision) to multiclass-classification learning (i.e., data-driven prediction), and through comparing the learning-based AS using k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine algorithms with conventional optimization-driven AS methods in terms of communications performance, computational complexity, and feedback overhead, we provide insight into the potential of fusion of machine learning and wireless communications.

AB This paper presents novel architectures for machine learning based classifiers using stochastic logic. Two types of classifier architectures are presented. These include: linear support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Stochastic computing systems require fewer logic gates and are inherently fault-tolerant. Thus, these structures are well suited for nanoscale CMOS technologies. These architectures are validated using seizure prediction from electroencephalogram (EEG) as an application example. To improve the accuracy of proposed stochastic classifiers, a novel approach based on linear transformation of input data is proposed for EEG signal classification using linear SVM classifiers. Simulation results in terms of the classification accuracy are presented for the proposed stochastic computing and the traditional binary implementations based datasets from one patient. Compared to conventional binary implementation, the accuracy of the proposed stochastic ANN is improved by 5.89%. Synthesis results are also presented for EEG signal classification. Compared to the traditional binary linear SVM, the hardware complexity, power consumption and critical path of the stochastic implementation are reduced by 78%, 74% and 53%, respectively. The hardware complexity, power consumption and critical path of the stochastic ANN classifier are reduced by 92%, 88% and 47%, respectively, compared to the conventional binary implementation.

AB We report a novel altimetry-based machine learning approach for eddy identification and characterization. The machine learning models use daily maps of geostrophic velocity anomalies and are trained according to the phase angle between the zonal and meridional components at each grid point. The trained models are then used to identify the corresponding eddy phase patterns and to predict the lifetime of a detected eddy structure. The performance of the proposed method is examined at two dynamically different regions to demonstrate its robust behavior and region independency.

AB This article investigates the dynamic interactions between four commodities prices and the exchange rate for an emerging economy, Malaysia. The literature has identified a series of contradictory claims in the support and against the accurate prediction of the exchange rate. This article provides a new methodology to perform a comparative analysis of the three machine learning techniques, namely: Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks, and RandomForest. The experimental results demonstrate that the RandomForest is comparatively better than Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks, for accuracy and performance. This shows that the fluctuation in the Malaysian exchange rate can be evaluated accurately using RandomForest as compare to other techniques. Furthermore, this paper reveals that Malaysian specific commodities prices- crude oil, palm oil, rubber, and gold, are the strong dynamic parameters that influence Malaysian exchange rate. Hence, these results are beneficial for policy making, investment modeling, and corporate planning.

AB In silicon testing, a Shmoo plot is commonly used to give us an insight into the silicon manufacturing development health. Shmoo plots and other silicon characterization data has high value, however, analysis of them is a time-consuming work. This paper establishes a machine learning based model to improve and automate the procedure in silicon data analysis for HVM test content development. Our experiment shows that the supervised learning model has good accuracy on VMIN estimation across various kinds of Shmoo issues (crack/sprinkle/ceiling). The accuracy attained is greatly improved over previous tools. The framework can be easily integrated into any automated tester software and would save time to market during first silicon characterization. Additionally, the methodology discussed in this work can be extended to the HVM test flow for silicon behavior.

AB In this study, it is aimed to create a sensor which may be able to learn with artificial intelligence. The sensor constituted is an industrial inclination sensor. Due to centrifugal force and/or shocking impacts, inclination sensors may have incorrect measurements. Decree of action that causes this error however has been measured by an acceleration sensor. It has been intended to remedy and correct the error of inclination and obtain a usable inclination data. Acceleration sensor, inclination sensor, data logger card have been installed on a platform. Inclination and acceleration values have been simultaneously observed and recorded. Data have been analyzed with WEKA Machine Learning Program. Rules obtained have been used as code in "Arduino". Thus, using the machine learning technique, and with the support of arduino programming card, a system which transforms measurements of inclination and acceleration sensor to utilizable inclination measurement value has been achieved.

AB Falls are the primary cause of accidents for the elderly in living environment. Falls frequently cause fatal and non-fatal injuries that are associated with a large amount of medical costs. Reduction hazards in living environment and doing exercise for training balance and muscle are the common strategies for fall prevention. But falls cannot be avoided completely; fall detection provides the alarm in time that can decrease the injuries or death caused by no rescue. We propose machine learning-based fall detection algorithm using multi-SVM with linear, quadratic or polynomial kernel function, and k-NN classifier. Eight kinds of falling postures and seven types of daily activities arranged in the experiment are used to explore the performance of the machine learning-based fall detection algorithm. The emulated falls were performed on a soft mat by ten healthy young subjects wearing protectors. The k-nearest neighbor method with 0.1 second window size has the highest accuracy, which is 96.26%. The results show that the proposed machine learning fall detection algorithm can fulfill the requirements of adaptability and flexibility for the individual differences.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a learning algorithm based on generalized single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network. Since ELM has an excellent performance on regression and classification problems, it has been paid more and more attention recently. The determination of structure of ELM plays a vital role in ELM applications. Essentially, determination of the structure of ELM is equivalent to the determination of the hidden layer structure. Utilizing a smaller scale of the hidden layer structure can promote faster running speed. In this paper, we propose algorithm PCI-ELM (Pruned-Convex Incremental Extreme Learning Machine) based on CI-ELM (Convex Incremental Extreme Learning Machine). Furthermore, we also present an improved PCI-ELM algorithm, EPCI-ELM (Enhanced Pruned-Convex Incremental Extreme Learning Machine), which introduces a filtering strategy for PCI-ELM during the neurons adding process. In order to adjust the single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network more flexibly and achieve the most compact form of the hidden layer structure, in this paper, we propose an algorithm which can dynamically determine hidden layer structure, DCI-ELM (Dynamic Convex Incremental Extreme Learning Machine). At the end of this paper, we verify the performance of PCI-ELM, EPCI-ELM and DCI-ELM. The results show that PCI-ELM, EPCI-ELM and DCI-ELM control hidden layer structure very well and construct the more compact single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Live virtual machine migration is one of the most promising features of data center virtualization technology. Numerous strategies have been proposed for live migration of virtual machines on local area networks. These strategies work perfectly in their respective domains with negligible downtime. However, these techniques are not suitable to handle live migration over wide area networks and results in significant downtime. In this paper we have proposed a Machine Learning based Downtime Optimization (MLDO) approach which is an adaptive live migration approach based on predictive mechanisms that reduces downtime during live migration over wide area networks for standard workloads. The main contribution of our work is to employ machine learning methods to reduce downtime. Machine learning methods are also used to introduce automated learning into the predictive model and adaptive threshold levels. We compare our proposed approach with existing strategies in terms of downtime observed during the migration process and have observed improvements in downtime of up to 15 %.

ID FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; APPROXIMATION
AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a learning algorithm for generalized single-hidden-layer feed-forward networks (SLFNs). In order to obtain a suitable network architecture, Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (I-ELM) is a sort of ELM constructing SLFNs by adding hidden nodes one by one. Although kinds of I-ELM-class algorithms were proposed to improve the convergence rate or to obtain minimal training error, they do not change the construction way of I-ELM or face the over-fitting risk. Making the testing error converge quickly and stably therefore becomes an important issue. In this paper, we proposed a new incremental ELM which is referred to as Length-Changeable Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (LCI-ELM). It allows more than one hidden node to be added to the network and the existing network will be regarded as a whole in output weights tuning. The output weights of newly added hidden nodes are determined using a partial error-minimizing method. We prove that an SLFN constructed using LCI-ELM has approximation capability on a universal compact input set as well as on a finite training set. Experimental results demonstrate that LCI-ELM achieves higher convergence rate as well as lower over-fitting risk than some competitive I-ELM-class algorithms.

AB Phishing websites are malicious sites which impersonate as legitimate web pages and they aim to reveal users important information such as user id, password, and credit card information. Detection of these phishing sites is a very challenging problem because phishing is mainly a semantics-based attack, which especially abuses human vulnerabilities, however not network or system vulnerabilities. As a software detection scheme, two main approaches are widely used: blacklists/whitelists and machine learning approaches. Machine learning solutions are able to detect zero-hour phishing attacks and they have superior adaption for new types of phishing attacks, therefore they are mainly preferred. To use this type of solution features of input must be selected carefully. The whole performance of the solution depends on these features. Therefore, in this paper, it is aimed to list and identify the important features for machine learning-based detection of phishing websites.

AB Here, we propose a fast deep learning architecture for feature representation. The target of deep learning in our model is to capture the relevant higher-level abstraction from disentangling input features, which is possible due to the speed of the extreme learning machine (ELM). We use ELM auto encoder (ELM-AE) to add a regularization term into ELM for improving generalization performance. To demonstrate our model with a high performance for deep representation, we conduct experiments on the MNIST database and compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art deep representation methods. Experimental results show the proposed method is competitive for deep representation and reduces amount of time needed for training.

AB Traditional kernel-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms usually have high computational complexity. Moreover, few SSL methods have been proposed to utilize both the manifold of unlabeled data and pairwise constraints effectively. In this paper, we first construct a unified SSL framework to combine the manifold regularization and the terms based on the pairwise constraints for semisupervised classification tasks. Motivated by the effectiveness of extreme learning machine (ELM), we further utilize ELM to approximate the established kernel-based SSL framework. Finally, we present a fast semi-supervised extreme learning machine with manifold regularization and pairwise constraints. Experimental results on a variety of real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fast SSL algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FRACTIONAL FLOW RESERVE
AB One of the physiology based clinical indices for coronary lesion severity, fractional flow reserve (FFR) is currently the gold standard for identifying the ischemia-causing stenosis in coronary circulation and for deciding revascularization of the clogged artery. In this study, we newly propose a machine learning based FFR prediction approach from geometric features of stenotic lesion and circulation conditions. We generated total 1,116 anatomic vessel models with various geometric features of a stenosis. FFR data were computed by 3D-0D coupled blood flow dynamics simulations. We employed a fully connected deep neural network model with four hidden layers and a sigmoidal activation function. The input layer has six neurons corresponds to geometric features of stenotic lesion as well as aortic pressure.
   This novel data-driven approach for near-real time assessment of coronary lesion severity has promising potential in on-site routine clinical practices.

AB Mortality modeling is crucial in economy, demography and in life and social insurance, because mortality rates determine insurance liabilities, prices of insurance products, and social benefit schemes. In this article we revisit Lee-Carter Model and study their calibration to Human Mortality Database and China mortality data. We illustrate how machine learning techniques allow us to study the adequacy of the estimated mortality rates based on Philippe Deprez, etl.(2017). By applying a regression tree boosting machine we analyze how the modeling should be improved based on feature components of an individual, such as its age or its birth cohort. The basic shape of logarithmic mortality curves of all ages has long-term stability. The development of a country's socio-economic level can only reduce the logarithmic mortality from the whole, without enlarging or narrowing the difference of logarithmic mortality in all ages.

AB Previous work has demonstrated that machine learning-based network intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be constructed to provide a significant proportion of the accuracy of a conventional signature-based IDS while using a fraction of the resources. Such systems are ideally suited to mobile tactical networks, which typically require much denser sensor coverage to ensure complete network protection and have relatively limited size, weight, and power budgets within which to both protect and operate the network. In this study, we extend previous work on the Extremely Lightweight Intrusion Detection system (ELIDe) and examine its ability to both store a wide range of signatures and generalize to new data. We also demonstrate the following: (1) ELIDe weight vectors are capable of storing multiple signatures while not significantly affecting the false-positive rate; (2) such weight vectors can detect packets that match the signatures on which they were trained with a high degree of accuracy (low false-negative rate); and (3), in addition to approximating the output of a conventional set of signatures, ELIDe weight vectors can also weakly generalize to novel malicious traffic. We show that, despite the significant challenges mobile tactical networks pose for intrusion detection, the use of machine learning allows the deployment of approximate signature-based intrusion detection in such networks.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION
AB In this paper, a learning algorithm based on particle swarm optimization method (PSO) and a novel heuristic optimization method of gravitational search algorithm (GSA) for extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed in terms of improving the generalization performance of single hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks, which is called as PSOGSA-ELM learning algorithm. The proposed learning algorithm uses a hybrid approach of PSO and GSA to select the optimal hidden biases and input weights of ELM, and then the output weights of ELM is analytically determined by the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by regression and classification benchmark problems and is compared with PSO-ELM, GSA-ELM, and the original ELM learning algorithms, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs equal to or better than the other algorithms in terms of generalization performance and has good convergence speed.

AB Analysis of time series data collected from mobile robots is getting more attention in many application areas. When multiple robots move through an environment to perform certain actions, an understanding of the environment viewed by each robot is essential. This paper presents analysis of robotic data using machine learning techniques when the data consist of multiple views of the environment. Robotic environments have been classified using the data captured by onboard sensors of mobile robots using a set of machine learning algorithms and their performances have been compared The machine learning model is validated using a test environment where some of the objects are displaced or removed from their designated position.

AB The real-time operator's mental workload (MWL) monitoring system is crucial for the design and development of adaptive operator-aiding/assistance systems. Although the data-driven approach has shown promising performance for MWL recognition, its major challenge lies in the difficulty in acquiring extensive labeled data. This paper attempts to apply the semi-supervised extreme learning machine (ELM) to the challenging problem of operator's mental workload classification based only on a small number of labeled physiological data. The real data analysis results show that the semi-supervised ELM method can effectively improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of the MWL pattern classification.

AB Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) has been introduced as a new algorithm for training single hidden layer feedforward neural networks instead of the classical gradient-based approaches. Based on the consistency property of data, which enforces similar samples to share similar properties, ELM is a biologically inspired learning algorithm that learns much faster with good generalization and performs well in classification tasks. However, the stochastic characteristics of hidden layer outputs from the random generation of the weight matrix in current ELMs leads to the possibility of unstable outputs in the learning and testing phases. This is detrimental to the overall performance when many repeated trials are conducted. To cope with this issue, we present a new ELM approach, named State Preserving Extreme Leaning Machine (SPELM). SPELM ensures the overall training and testing performance of the classical ELM while monotonically increases its accuracy by preserving state variables. For evaluation, experiments are performed on different benchmark datasets including applications in face recognition, pedestrian detection, and network intrusion detection for cyber security. Several popular feature extraction techniques, namely Gabor, pyramid histogram of oriented gradients, and local binary pattern are also incorporated with SPELM. Experimental results show that our SPELM algorithm yields the best performance on tested data over ELM and RELM.

AB We present elegant machine learning algorithms to efficiently learn natural language semantics (MLANLP); thus enabling much better Natural Language Computing (NLC) and Cognitive Computing (CC). Our algorithms use human brainlike learning approach and achieve very good generalization on natural language (mainly text) data. Existing machine learning algorithms performs well on numerical data and cannot easily learn semantics of natural language. Such algorithms, however, can address well some specific problems of natural language, like Name Entity Recognition where data can be easily represented by numbers and semantics between words (name and entity) are simple. Besides, the generalization capabilities of existing machine learning algorithms are limited, especially for complex data. The generalization capability for learning semantics of natural language should be very good to ensure reliable NLC and CC. Our MLANLP has good generalization capability, and can also derive new semantics and knowledge, very much needed for NLC and CC.

AB Teaching a computer to read and answer general questions pertaining to a document is a challenging yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we describe a novel neural network architecture called the Reasoning Network (ReasoNet) for machine comprehension tasks. ReasoNets make use of multiple turns to effectively exploit and then reason over the relation among queries, documents, and answers. Different from previous approaches using a fixed number of turns during inference, ReasoNets introduce a termination state to relax this constraint on the reasoning depth. With the use of reinforcement learning, ReasoNets can dynamically determine whether to continue the comprehension process after digesting intermediate results, or to terminate reading when it concludes that existing information is adequate to produce an answer. ReasoNets achieve superior performance in machine comprehension datasets, including unstructured CNN and Daily Mail datasets, the Stanford SQUAD dataset, and a structured Graph Reachability dataset.

AB We examined a process for automating the classification of articles in MEDLINE aimed at minimising manual effort without sacrificing accuracy. From 22,808 articles pertaining to 19 antidepressants, 1000 were randomly selected and manually labelled according to article type (including, randomised controlled trials, editorials, etc.). We applied a machine learning approach termed 'active learning', where the learner (machine) selects the order in which the user (human) labels examples. Via simulation, we determined the number of articles a user needed to label to produce a classifier with at least 95% recall and 90% precision in three scenarios related to evidence synthesis. We found that the active learning process reduced the number of training instances required by 70%, 19%, and 14% in the three scenarios. The results show that the active learning method may be used in some scenarios to produce accurate classifiers that meet the needs of evidence synthesis tasks and reduce manual effort.

AB Semi-supervised learning has been applied in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to reduce calibration time for user. For example, a sequential updated self-training least squares support vector machine (SUST-LSSVM) was devised for online semi-supervised P300 speller. Despite its good performance, the computational complexity becomes too high after several updates, which hinders its practical online application. In this paper, we present a self-training regularized weighted online sequential extreme learning machine (ST-RWOS-ELM) for P300 speller. It achieves much lower complexity compared to SUST-LSSVM without affecting the spelling accuracy performance. The experimental results validate its effectiveness in the P300 system.

AB For an information security manager it can be a daunting task to keep up and assess which new cyber vulnerabilities to prioritize patching first. Every day numerous new vulnerabilities and exploits are reported for a wide variety of different software configurations. We use machine learning to make automatic predictions for unseen vulnerabilities based on previous exploit patterns. As sources for historic vulnerability data, we use the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and the Exploit Database (EDB). Our work shows that common words from the vulnerability descriptions, external references, and vendor products, are the most important features to consider. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores and categorical parameters, and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers are redundant when a large number of common words are used, since this information is often contained within the vulnerability description. Using machine learning algorithms, it is possible to get a prediction accuracy of 83% for binary classification. In comparison, the performance differences between some of the algorithms are marginal with respect to metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The best classifier with respect to both performance metrics and execution time is a linear time Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. We conclude that in order to get better predictions the data quality must be enhanced.

AB In this paper, we present a new approach for breast tissue classification using the features derived from electrical impedance spectroscopy. This method is composed of a feature extraction method, feature selection phase and a classification step. The feature extraction phase derives the features from the electrical impedance spectra. The extracted features consist of the impedivity at zero frequency (I0), the phase angle at 500KHz, the high-frequency slope of phase angle, the impedance distance between spectral ends, the area under spectrum, the normalised area, the maximum of the spectrum, the distance between impedivity at I0 and the real part of the maximum frequency point and the length of the spectral curve. The system uses the information theoretic criterion as a strategy for feature selection and the combining extreme learning machines (ELMs) for the classification phase. The results of several ELMs are combined using the support vector machines classifier, and the result of classification is reported as a measure of the performance of the system. The results indicate that the proposed system achieves high accuracy in classification of breast tissues using the electrical impedance spectroscopy.

AB Ontology reasoning is typically a computationally intensive operation. While soundness and completeness of results is required in some use cases, for many others, a sensible trade-off between computation efforts and correctness of results makes more sense. In this paper, we show that it is possible to approximate a central task in reasoning, i.e., A-box consistency checking, by training a machine learning model which approximates the behavior of that reasoner for a specific ontology. On four different datasets, we show that such learned models constantly achieve an accuracy above 95% at less than 2% of the runtime of a reasoner, using a decision tree with no more than 20 inner nodes. For example, this allows for validating 293M Microdata documents against the schema. org ontology in less than 90 min, compared to 18 days required by a state of the art ontology reasoner.

AB Cyanobacteria bloom is a serious public health threat and a global challenge. Literature on the bloom prediction and forecasting has been accumulating and the emphasis appears to have been on the relation between the blooms and environmental factors, whilst the complexity of the bloom mechanism makes it difficult to reach adequate output of the models. Rapid development of next generation sequencing techniques provides a way in which comprehensive and quick examination of the microbial community can be achieved, especially for the bloom community structure. This facilitates using of merely the sequence data along with the machine learning techniques to predict and forecast the bloom occurrence. But there has been rare report on this theme in the literature. In this case study, machine learning approaches were applied with the metagenomic data as the only input (rather than with environmental data) to predict the Cyanobacteria blooms. k-NN classification, SVM classification and k-means clustering were applied and their efficiencies were evaluated using relevant indices. Feature selection was performed and the yielded sub datasets were worked on seriatim. In the predicting experiment with k-NN approach, the final year's data among the 8 years OTU time series were used as target data and various combination of the preceding years' data were used as predictor data; the output came with the best values of 1.00 and 100% for the evaluation indices F1score and sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy, for the 7 preceding years' predictor input, among the experiment results. This case study demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning approaches in the Cyanobacteria bloom prediction with only metagenomic sequence data, and the importance of feature selection processing in obtaining better output of the machine learning approaches. The metagenomic data based machine learning approaches are efficient, economic, and faster, possessing the advantage and potential for being adopted as a promising means in the bloom prediction practice.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB An experimental setup of 32 honeypots reported 17M login attempts originating from 112 different countries and over 6000 distinct source IP addresses. Due to decoupled control and data plane, Software Defined Networks (SDN) can handle these increasing number of attacks by blocking those network connections at the switch level. However, the challenge lies in defining the set of rules on the SDN controller to block malicious network connections. Historical network attack data can be used to automatically identify and block the malicious connections. There are a few existing open-source software tools to monitor and limit the number of login attempts per source IP address one-by-one. However, these solutions cannot efficiently act against a chain of attacks that comprises multiple IP addresses used by each attacker. In this paper, we propose using machine learning algorithms, trained on historical network attack data, to identify the potential malicious connections and potential attack destinations. We use four widely-known machine learning algorithms: C4.5, Bayesian Network (BayesNet), Decision Table (DT), and Naive-Bayer to predict the host that will be attacked based on the historical data. Experimental results show that average prediction accuracy of 91.68% is attained using Bayesian Networks.

DE Dynamic Virtual Machine Consolidation; Multi Agent Learning
AB Distributed dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation (DDVMC) is a virtual machine management strategy that uses a distributed rather than a centralized algorithm for finding a right balance between saving energy and attaining best possible performance in cloud data center. One of the significant challenges in DDVMC is that the optimality of this strategy is highly dependent on the quality of the decision-making process. In this paper we propose a cooperative multi agent learning approach to tackle this challenge. The experimental results show that our approach yields far better results w.r.t. the energy-performance tradeoff in cloud data centers in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Approximation of unknown functions in multiple dimensions is an important topic in many areas of industrial engineering, such as nonlinear control. Currently, approaches such as neural networks or fuzzy systems are used to create highly nonlinear surfaces from data. Here we show the capabilities of a very simple classical numerical method such as cubic spline to compete with state of the art machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Fuzzy Systems (FS), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). Machine learning techniques have many issues such as choosing rules or building a network architecture that can be avoided. Without randomness in the initialization process, there is no need to run the same problem hundreds of times to get a good result. The proposed methods are tested on a variety of problems pertaining to industrial applications against many popular algorithms. Experimental results show that simple cubic splines are indeed competitive in terms of computation time and approximation accuracy when compared with adaptive methods.

DE malware classification; online machine learning; dynamic analysis
AB Identification of malware's family is an intricate process whose success and accuracy depends on different factors. These factors are mainly related to the process of extracting of meaningful and distinctive features from a set of malware samples, modeling malware via its static or dynamic features and particularly techniques used to classify malware samples. In this paper, we propose a new malware classification method based on behavioral features. File system, network, registry activities observed during the execution traces of the malware samples are used to represent behavior based features. Existing classification schemes apply machine-learning algorithms to the stored data, i. e., they are off-line. In this study, we use on-line machine learning algorithms that can provide instantaneous update about the new malware sample by following its introduction to the classification scheme. To validate the effectiveness and scalability of our method, we have evaluated our method by using 18,000 recent malicious files. Experimental results show that our method classifies malware with an accuracy of 92%.

AB R is a multi-paradigm language with a dynamic type system, different object systems and functional characteristics. These characteristics support the development of statistical algorithms at a high level of abstraction. Although R is commonly used in the statistics domain a big disadvantage are its runtime problems when handling computation-intensive algorithms. Especially in the domain of machine learning the execution of pure R programs is often unacceptably slow. Our long-term goal is to resolve these issues and in this contribution we used the traceR tool to analyse the bottlenecks arising in this domain. Here we measured the runtime and overall memory consumption on a well-defined set of classical machine learning applications and gained detailed insights into the performance issues of these programs.

AB Due to its simple, fast, and good generalization ability, extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently drawn increasing attention in the pattern recognition and machine learning fields. To investigate the performance of ELM on the hyperspectral images (HSIs), this paper proposes two spatial-spectral composite kernel (CK) ELM classification methods. In the proposed CK framework, the single spatial or spectral kernel consists of activation-function-based kernel and general Gaussian kernel, respectively. The proposed methods inherit the advantages of ELM and have an analytic solution to directly implement the multiclass classification. Experimental results on three benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed ELM with CK methods outperform the general ELM, SVM, and SVM with CK methods.

AB Semi-supervised kernel learning methods have been received much more attention in the past few years. Traditional semi-supervised Non-Parametric Kernel Learning (NPKL) methods usually formulate the learning task as a Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) problem, which is very time consuming. Although some fast semi-supervised NPKL methods have been proposed recently, they usually scale very poorly. Furthermore, many semi-supervised NPKL methods are developed based on the manifold assumption. But, such an assumption might be invalid when handling some high-dimensional and sparse data, which has severely negative effect on the performance of learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a more efficient semi-supervised NPKL method, which can effectively learn a low-rank kernel matrix from must-link and cannot-link constraints. Specially, by virtue of the nonlinear spectral embedded technique based on extreme learning machine (ELM), the proposed method has the ability of coping with data points that do not have a clear manifold structure in a low dimensional space. The proposed method is formulated as a trace ratio optimization problem, which is combined with dimensionality reduction in ELM feature space and aims to find optimal low-rank kernel matrices. The proposed optimization problem can be solved much more efficiently than SDP solvers. Extensive experiments have validated the superior performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised kernel learning methods.

AB The enhancement of speech degraded with the non-stationary noise types that typify real-world conditions has remained a challenging problem for several decades. However, recent use of data driven methods for this task has brought great performance improvements. In this paper, we develop a speech enhancement framework based on the extreme learning machine. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective in suppressing additive noise. Furthermore, it is always superior to a leading minimum mean square error (MMSE) algorithm in matched noise, and exceeds the said algorithm's performance in mismatched noise at all but the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tested.

AB Machine learning classifiers are basic research tools used in numerous types of network analysis and modeling. To reduce the need for domain expertise and costs of running local ML classifiers, network researchers can instead rely on centralized Machine Learning as a Service ( MLaaS) platforms.
   In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of MLaaS systems ranging from fully-automated, turnkey systems to fully-customizable systems, and find that with more user control comes greater risk. Good decisions produce even higher performance, and poor decisions result in harsher performance penalties. We also find that server side optimizations help fully-automated systems outperform default settings on competitors, but still lag far behind well-tuned MLaaS systems which compare favorably to standalone ML libraries. Finally, we find classifier choice is the dominating factor in determining model performance, and that users can approximate the performance of an optimal classifier choice by experimenting with a small subset of random classifiers. While network researchers should approach MLaaS systems with caution, they can achieve results comparable to standalone classifiers if they have sufficient insight into key decisions like classifiers and feature selection.

AB Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular research topics in last years. There are lots of data on web which require analysis in order for them to become useful. Many researchers have focused on making sense of these data. Therefore, sentiment analysis concept is proposed. Sentiment analysis methods try to emerge any opinions, feelings, and subjectivity behind the text. Machine learning algorithms and vocabulary based methods are used to perform sentiment analysis. In this research, (i) recently studied researches on machine learning based sentiment analysis are investigated to give background; (ii) they are classified according to their tasks on extracting information; (iii) the encountered and potential challenges on this research topic are revisited and discussed.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been introduced as a new algorithm for training single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs) instead of the classical gradient-based algorithms. Based on the consistency property of data, which enforce similar samples to share similar properties, ELM is a biologically inspired learning algorithm with SLFNs that learns much faster with good generalization and performs well in classification applications. However, the random generation of the weight matrix in current ELM based techniques leads to the possibility of unstable outputs in the learning and testing phases. Therefore, we present a novel approach for computing the weight matrix in ELM which forms a State Preserving Extreme Leaning Machine (SPELM). The SPELM stabilizes ELM training and testing outputs while monotonically increases its accuracy by preserving state variables. Furthermore, three popular feature extraction techniques, namely Gabor, Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients (PHOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) are incorporated with the SPELM for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm yields the best performance on the widely used face datasets such as Yale, eMU and ORL compared to state-of-the-art ELM based classifiers.

AB A key challenge of HRI is allowing robots to be adaptable, especially as robots are expected to penetrate society at large and to interact in unexpected environments with nontechnical users. One way of providing this adaptability is to use Interactive Machine Learning, i.e. having a human supervisor included in the learning process who can steer the action selection and the learning in the desired direction. We ran a study exploring how people use numeric rewards to evaluate a robot's behaviour and guide its learning. From the results we derive a number of challenges when designing learning robots: what kind of input should the human provide? How should the robot communicate its state or its intention? And how can the teaching process by made easier for human supervisors?

AB The training of traditional SVM method requires the solution of quadratic programming, and consumes high memory and has low speed for large data training. Incremental learning is one of the meaningful methods to continuously update the data for learning, which keeps the previous learning results, re learning only for the additional data, so as to form a continuous learning process. This paper will study the support vector machine based on incremental learning method and its application in the malware detection. The experiments carried out in the Internet Security Laboratory at Kingsoft Corporation suggested that, for large number of virus samples, our method can rapidly and effectively update the sample features, which avoids duplication of learning history samples and ensures the malware prediction ability for the detection model.

AB In recent years, the interest in the study of outlier robustness properties in Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) has grown. Most of the published works uses a more robust estimation method than the commonly adopted ordinary least squares. Nevertheless, the ELM network offers other challenges that also influence its robustness properties, such as the number of hidden neurons and the computational stability of the hidden layer's output matrix. That being said, we propose here two networks: ROP-ELM and ROPP-ELM that address the three aforementioned problems at once, in a combination of a pruning method, a cost function based on l(1)-norm and the addition of a biologically plausible mechanism named Intrinsic Plasticity.

AB The emergence of the big data problem has pushed the machine learning research community to develop unsupervised, distributed and computationally efficient learning algorithms to benefit from this data. Extreme learning machines ELM) have gained popularity as a neuron based architecture with fast training time and good generalization. In this work, we parallelize an ELM algorithm for unsupervised learning on a distributed framework to learn clustering models from big data based on the unsupervised ELM algorithm proposed in the literature. We propose three approaches to do so: 1) Parallel US-ELM which simply distributes the data over computing nodes, 2) Hierarchical US-ELM which hierarchically clusters the data and 3) Ensemble US-ELM which is an ensemble of weak ELM models. The algorithms achieved faster training times compared to their serial counterparts and generalized better than other clustering algorithms in the literature, when tested on multiple datasets from UCI.

AB Mobile devices are especially vulnerable nowadays to malware attacks, thanks to the current trend of increased app downloads. Despite the significant security and privacy concerns it received, effective malware detection (MD) remains a significant challenge. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a streaminglized machine learning-based MD framework, StormDroid: (i) The core of StormDroid is based on machine learning, enhanced with a novel combination of contributed features that we observed over a fairly large collection of data set; and (ii) we streaminglize the whole MD process to support large-scale analysis, yielding an efficient and scalable MD technique that observes app behaviors statically and dynamically. Evaluated on roughly 8,000 applications, our combination of contributed features improves MD accuracy by almost 10% compared with state-of-the-art antivirus systems; in parallel our streaminglized process, StormDroid, further improves efficiency rate by approximately three times than a single thread.

AB The forecasting of evaporative loss (E) is vital for water resource management and understanding of hydrological process for farming practices, ecosystem management and hydrologic engineering. This study has developed three machine learning algorithms, namely the relevance vector machine (RVM), extreme learning machine (ELM) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) for the prediction of E using five predictor variables, incident solar radiation (S), maximum temperature (T (max)), minimum temperature (T (min)), atmospheric vapor pressure (VP) and precipitation (P). The RVM model is based on the Bayesian formulation of a linear model with appropriate prior that results in sparse representations. The ELM model is computationally efficient algorithm based on Single Layer Feedforward Neural Network with hidden neurons that randomly choose input weights and the MARS model is built on flexible regression algorithm that generally divides solution space into intervals of predictor variables and fits splines (basis functions) to each interval. By utilizing random sampling process, the predictor data were partitioned into the training phase (70 % of data) and testing phase (remainder 30 %). The equations for the prediction of monthly E were formulated. The RVM model was devised using the radial basis function, while the ELM model comprised of 5 inputs and 10 hidden neurons and used the radial basis activation function, and the MARS model utilized 15 basis functions. The decomposition of variance among the predictor dataset of the MARS model yielded the largest magnitude of the Generalized Cross Validation statistic (a parts per thousand 0.03) when the T (max) was used as an input, followed by the relatively lower value (a parts per thousand 0.028, 0.019) for inputs defined by the S and VP. This confirmed that the prediction of E utilized the largest contributions of the predictive features from the T (max), verified emphatically by sensitivity analysis test. The model performance statistics yielded correlation coefficients of 0.979 (RVM), 0.977 (ELM) and 0.974 (MARS), Root-Mean-Square-Errors of 9.306, 9.714 and 10.457 and Mean-Absolute-Error of 0.034, 0.035 and 0.038. Despite the small differences in the overall prediction skill, the RVM model appeared to be more accurate in prediction of E. It is therefore advocated that the RVM model can be employed as a promising machine learning tool for the prediction of evaporative loss.

AB Basketball referees are important in a basketball game. In this paper, we analyze the performance of basketball referees in a game from history data and using the machine learning techniques. The data are collected from Taiwan Super Basketball League games. We first observed that the teamwork is a key factor to the performance of referee teams. Furthermore, the degree of teamwork are more important than the personal capabilities. Then, we derived some classifiers by machine learning algorithms to further analyze the data set. Among the three classifiers, a classifier named linear classifier using pocket algorithm, which is able to classify the data points with most correct rate, performs better than the other two classifiers. The classifier also proved the importance of teamwork is much larger than that of personal capability. In the future, the classifier can be used to predict the performance of a referee team in a basketball game.

AB This paper proposes a nonlinear PLS modeling method. The extreme learning machine (ELM) is embedded in the process of linear PLS modeling. Thus the linear PLS modeling is transformed into the nonlinear frame which can deal with nonlinear data. The multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear modeling task is decomposed into two parts: the external linear modeling and inner univariate nonlinear modeling problems. The linear PLS method is used to establish the external model, while the extreme learning machine is used to capture the inner nonlinear model. Compared to the standard PLS method, the method in this paper has the potential of modeling any continuous nonlinear relationship and has better robust properties. And it is less time-consuming than other neural networks PLS (NNPLS) methods. Because extreme learning machine can capture the inner nonlinearity of data, the proposed method has better prediction performance than linear PLS regression method. Simulation verifies the better prediction performance and the validity of the proposed method.

AB Wide use of internet and web applications like, feedback collection systems are now making peoples smarter. In these applications, peoples used to give their feedback about the movies, products, services, etc through which they have gone, and this feedback are publicly available for future references. It is a tedious task for the machines to identify the feedback types, i:e positive or negative. And here Machine Learning Techniques plays vital roles to train the machine and make it intelligent so that the machine will be able to identify the feedback type which may give more benefits and features for those web applications and the users. There are many supervised machine learning techniques are available so it is a difficult task to choose the best one.
   In this paper, we have collected the movie review datasets of different sizes and have selected some of the widely used and popular supervised machine learning algorithms, for training the model. So that the model will be able to categorize the review. Python's NLTK package along with the WinPython and Spyder are used for processing the movie reviews. Then Python's sklearn package is used for training the model and finding the accuracy of the model.

This paper proposes a complete framework to cope with the surface defects detection of mobile phone panel workpieces. The proposed method has a set of consecutive handling processes: original image cutting and standardization, image blocks segmentation and feature extraction, machine learning embedded defects detection. We empirically prove the capability of the proposed method for detecting defects of mobile phone panel surface. The comparison with different algorithms further show that our method achieves excellent performance for mobile phone panel surface defects detection task in both detecting accuracy and detecting speed.

AB Introduction: The use of computational tools in the early stages of drug development has increased in recent decades. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been of special interest, since they can be applied in several steps of the drug discovery methodology, such as prediction of target structure, prediction of biological activity of new ligands through model construction, discovery or optimization of hits, and construction of models that predict the pharmacokinetic and toxicological (ADMET) profile of compounds.
   Areas covered: This article presents an overview on some applications of ML techniques in drug design. These techniques can be employed in ligand-based drug design (LBDD) and structure-based drug design (SBDD) studies, such as similarity searches, construction of classification and/or prediction models of biological activity, prediction of secondary structures and binding sites docking and virtual screening.
   Expert opinion: Successful cases have been reported in the literature, demonstrating the efficiency of ML techniques combined with traditional approaches to study medicinal chemistry problems. Some ML techniques used in drug design are: support vector machine, random forest, decision trees and artificial neural networks. Currently, an important application of ML techniques is related to the calculation of scoring functions used in docking and virtual screening assays from a consensus, combining traditional and ML techniques in order to improve the prediction of binding sites and docking solutions.

AB We consider the field of machine learning and where it is both useful, and not useful, for the distribution grid and buildings interface. While analytics, in general, is a growing field of interest, and often seen as the golden goose in the burgeoning distribution grid industry, its application is often limited by communications infrastructure, or lack of a focused technical application. Overall, the linkage of analytics to purposeful application in the grid space has been limited. In this paper we consider the field of machine learning as a subset of analytical techniques, and discuss its ability and limitations to enable the future distribution grid. To that end, we also consider the potential for mixing distributed and centralized analytics and the pros and cons of these approaches. There is an exponentially expanding volume of measured data being generated on the distribution grid, which, with appropriate application of analytics, may be transformed into intelligible, actionable information that can be provided to the right actors - such as grid and building operators, at the appropriate time to enhance grid or building resilience, efficiency, and operations against various metrics or goals - such as total carbon reduction or other economic benefit to customers. While some basic analysis into these data streams can provide a wealth of information, computational and human boundaries on performing the analysis are becoming significant, with more data and multi-objective concerns. Efficient applications of analysis and the machine learning field are being considered in the loop. This paper describes benefits and limits of present machine-learning applications for use on the grid and presents a series of case studies that illustrate the potential benefits of developing advanced local multi-variate analytics machine-learning-based applications.

AB In this paper, a Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) based on artificial intelligence is proposed to distribute the limited radio spectrum resources more efficiently. The CRN framework can analyze the time-sensitive signal data close to the signal source using fog computing with different types of machine learning techniques. Depending on the computational capabilities of the fog nodes, different features and machine learning techniques are chosen to optimize spectrum allocation. Also, the computing nodes send the periodic signal summary which is much smaller than the original signal to the cloud so that the overall system spectrum source allocation strategies are dynamically updated. Applying fog computing, the system is more adaptive to the local environment and robust to spectrum changes. As most of the signal data is processed at the fog level, it further strengthens the system security by reducing the communication burden of the communications network.

AB In the process of building design, energy performance is often simulated using physical principles of thermodynamics and energy behaviour using elaborate simulation tools. However, energy simulation is computationally expensive and time consuming process. These drawbacks limit opportunities for design space exploration and prevent interactive design which results in environmentally inefficient buildings. In this paper we propose Energy Model Machine (EMM) as a general and flexible approximation model for instant energy performance prediction using machine learning (ML) algorithms to facilitate design space exploration in building design process. EMM can easily be added to design tools and provide instant feedback for real- time design iterations. To demonstrate its applicability, EMM is used to estimate energy performance of a medium size office building during the design space exploration in widely used parametrically design tool as a case study. The results of this study support the feasibility of using machine learning approaches to estimate energy performance for design exploration and optimization workflows to achieve high performance buildings.

AB In Precision Agriculture one of the basic tasks is the classification of land zones in either arable or non-arable land. Several studies have been conducted using data obtained from soil analysis or local exploration of the parcels. However, sometimes only data from satellite images are available and then the problem not only becomes more challenging but also more interesting to solve because it is much more cost-effective. In this paper, we consider different spectral and thermal bands from the Landsat 8 satellite images corresponding to a vineyard located in Galicia, a region in Northeastern Spain, and apply a range of supervised Machine Learning methods to classify the different land zones. We conclude that an adequate choice of the algorithm parameters together with feature selection techniques can yield a classification that is both highly effective and efficient.

AB Track geometry has a considerable effect on rail travel comfort and safety and deteriorates with age and tonnage. In order to maintain the track geometry quality, maintenance activities such as tamping, stone blowing and ballast undercutting are usually employed. However, these activities are ineffective if the underlying cause of track deformation such as subgrade failure is not addressed. Geosynthetics such as geocells and geogrids can be placed in the subballast which strengthens the layer, lowers the stresses on the weak subgrade and invariably enhances track geometry quality. Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly imperative in processing and analyzing of large volumes of track geometry data which exhibit the classical attributes of big data. Several unsupervised and supervised learning techniques were used to analyze the effect of geocell installation on track geometry quality. Cluster analysis was used to group the track geometry data with major clusters found to differ by surface and alignment features. Principal component analysis was employed as an effective dimension reduction tool to simplify the track geometry data based on the proportion of variance explained. Supervised learning techniques such as multiple linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression and support vector regression were subsequently used to estimate and predict the effect of geocell installation on the track geometry quality. Random forest regression was found to the best performing model for both the original and dimensionally-reduced data.

AB This paper proposes a novel algorithm, termed random Fourier extreme learning machine with l(2,1)-norm regularization, to improve the robustness and compactness of the widely used extreme learning machine. In specific, we firstly introduce the random Fourier mappings as activation functions to approximate the Gaussian kernel, with the aim to improve the extendibility of the powerful kernel ELM algorithms. We then adopt the l(2,1)-norm to eliminate the potential irrelevant neurons, resulting in a more compact and discriminative hidden layer. After that, we propose an efficient algorithm with proved convergence to solve the resultant optimization problem. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 30 benchmark data sets to compare the proposed algorithm with six popular extreme learning algorithms. As observed, our algorithm outperforms the enumerated hidden layer reinforcement algorithms. In addition, it significantly improves the computational efficiency of Gaussian kernel extreme learning machine with comparable classification and regression performance in large scale learning scenarios.

TI A machine learning approach to query generation in plagiarism source

DE Plagiarism detection; Source retrieval; Query generation; Machine

AB Plagiarism source retrieval is the core task of plagiarism detection. It has become the standard for plagiarism detection to use the queries extracted from suspicious documents to retrieve the plagiarism sources. Generating queries from a suspicious document is one of the most important steps in plagiarism source retrieval. Heuristic-based query generation methods are widely used in the current research. Each heuristic-based method has its own advantages, and no one statistically outperforms the others on all suspicious document segments when generating queries for source retrieval. Further improvements on heuristic methods for source retrieval rely mainly on the experience of experts. This leads to difficulties in putting forward new heuristic methods that can overcome the shortcomings of the existing ones. This paper paves the way for a new statistical machine learning approach to select the best queries from the candidates. The statistical machine learning approach to query generation for source retrieval is formulated as a ranking framework. Specifically, it aims to achieve the optimal source retrieval performance for each suspicious document segment. The proposed method exploits learning to rank to generate queries from the candidates. To our knowledge, our work is the first research to apply machine learning methods to resolve the problem of query generation for source retrieval. To solve the essential problem of an absence of training data for learning to rank, the building of training samples for source retrieval is also conducted. We rigorously evaluate various aspects of the proposed method on the publicly available PAN source retrieval corpus. With respect to the established baselines, the experimental results show that applying our proposed query generation method based on machine learning yields statistically significant improvements over baselines in source retrieval effectiveness.

AB Design patterns helpful for software development are the reusable abstract documents which provide acceptable solutions for the recurring design problems. But in the process of reverse engineering, it is often desired to identify as well as recognize design pattern from source code, as it improves maintainability and documentation of the source code. In this study, the process of software design pattern recognition is presented which is based on machine learning techniques. Firstly, a training dataset is developed which is based on software metrics. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms such as Layer Recurrent Neural Network and Decision Tree are applied for patterns detection process. In order to evaluate the proposed study, an open source software i.e., JHotDraw 7.0.6 has been used for the recognition of design patterns.

AB Extreme learning machine for single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks has been extensively applied in imbalanced data learning due to its fast learning capability. Ensemble approach can effectively improve the classification performance by combining several weak learners according to a certain rule. In this paper, a novel ensemble approach on weighted extreme learning machine for imbalanced data classification problem is proposed. The weight of each base learner in the ensemble is optimized by differential evolution algorithm. Experimental results on 12 datasets show that the proposed method could achieve more classification performance compared with the simple vote-based ensemble method and non-ensemble method.

AB Machine learning based hot spot detection is an emerging area in verification of mask and layout design. In machine learning, feature extraction methods suitable for application domains are as important as learning and inference algorithm itself for detection accuracy. In this paper, several feature extraction methods were proposed and implemented, and compared using a standard bench mark dataset. Preferable characteristics for the good feature extraction will be discussed. Comparison studies indicated that combination of a good feature extraction method and a standard machine learning algorithm often gave excellent results compared with previously reported results.

AB Data used in machine learning applications is prone to contain both vague and incomplete information. Many authors have proposed to use fuzzy rough set theory in the development of new techniques tackling these characteristics. Fuzzy sets deal with vague data, while rough sets allow to model incomplete information. As such, the hybrid setting of the two paradigms is an ideal candidate tool to confront the separate challenges. In this paper, we present a thorough review on the use of fuzzy rough sets in machine learning applications. We recall their integration in preprocessing methods and consider learning algorithms in the supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised domains and outline future challenges. Throughout the paper, we highlight the interaction between theoretical advances on fuzzy rough sets and practical machine learning tools that take advantage of them.

AB the machine learning is more effective today in anomaly detection to improve the classification accuracy. The use of powerful kernel based learning is very practical in current trends may expose accurate results in real time database applications. In this context, we need to use the new and adorned machine learning classifiers. In this paper we have given very successful and emerged kernels SVM ( Support Vector Machines) which uses the marginal hyperplane uniquely determine the classes by mapping of data and KPCA ( Kernel Principal Component Analysis) is an extension to PCA. Both used to classify the data and detecting anomalies by transforming input space into high dimensional feature space. The SVM kernel is use non-linear mapping function and inner product replace with kernel ingredients. KPCA extract principal components from set of corresponding eigenvectors and used as threshold with reference to kernel width. The SVM and KPCA are implemented by taking one real-time bank dataset and other from UCI machine learning repository sets. Finally performance compared with non-kernel techniques ( CART, k-NN, PLSDA, PCA) applied on same datasets using training and test set combinations.

AB Since it has the ability to give a faster result than traditional machine learning algorithms, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has become increasingly popular in various research fields recently. However, ELM has been worked on the research of computer science and other related areas except for the atmospheric field. This paper uses the ELM algorithm to simulate the forward integrating process of an ocean-atmosphere oscillator model -- El-Nino/La-Nina Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The results show that the ELM algorithm has a good accuracy and efficiency with a quick convergence speed and a strong resistance over observation noises.

AB EEG signal is considered a dynamical system, difficult and complex to learn. Therefore Brain Computer Interface Systems need to manage specific time variations of the EEG since the extracted feature are non-stationary. This paper presents a study to test Extreme Learning Machine as a suitable classification method for Motor Imagery Brain Computer Interface. In order to take in to account the time course of the signals new descriptors from three widely known Feature Extraction methods (Power Spectral Density, Hjorth parameters and Adaptive AutoregRessive coefficients) have been obtained by three different techniques: central window, averaging features and linking features. Results shows that these new descriptors have improved the performance of the Extreme Learning Machine with respect classical techniques.

ID REGRESSION
AB Conventional kernel support vector machine (KSVM) has the problem of slow training speed, and single kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) also has some performance limitations, for which this paper proposes a new combined KELM model that build by the polynomial kernel and reproducing kernel on Sobolev Hilbert space. This model combines the advantages of global and local kernel function and has fast training speed. At the same time, an efficient optimization algorithm called cuckoo search algorithm is adopted to avoid blindness and inaccuracy in parameter selection. Experiments were performed on bi-spiral benchmark dataset, Banana dataset, as well as a number of classification and regression datasets from the UCI benchmark repository illustrate the feasibility of the proposed model. It achieves the better robustness and generalization performance when compared to other conventional KELM and KSVM, which demonstrates its effectiveness and usefulness.

AB Driven by the need to improve efficiency, modern buildings are instrumented with numerous sensors to monitor utilization and regulate environmental conditions. While these sensor systems serve as valuable tools for managing the comfort and health of occupants, there is an increasing need to expand the deployment of sensors to provide additional insights. Because many of these desired insights have high temporal value, such as occupancy during emergency situations, such insights are needed in real time. However, augmenting buildings with new sensors is often expensive and requires a significant capital investment.
   In this paper, we propose and describe the real-time, streaming system called Namatad that we developed to infer insights from many sensors typical of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. We evaluate the effectiveness of this platform by leveraging machine learning to infer new insights from environmental sensors within buildings. We describe how we built the components of our system leveraging several open source, streaming frameworks. We also describe how we ingest and aggregate from building sensors and sensing platforms, route data streams to appropriate models, and make predictions using machine learning techniques. Using our system, we have been able to predict the occupancy of rooms within a building on the University of Washington campus over the last three months, in real time, at accuracies of up to 95%.

AB In our society, many fields have produced a large number of data streams. How to mining the interesting knowledge and patterns from continuous data stream becomes a problem which we have to solve. Different from conventional classification algorithms, data stream classification algorithms have to adjust their classification models with the change of data stream because of concept drift. However, conventional classification models will keep stable once models are trained. To solve the problem, a dynamic extreme learning machine for data stream classification (DELM) is proposed. DELM utilizes online learning mechanism to train ELM as basic classifier and trains a double hidden layer structure to improve the performance of ELM. When an alert about concept drift is set, more hidden layer nodes are added into ELM to improve the generalization ability of classifier. If the value measuring concept drift reaches the upper limit or the accuracy of ELM is in a low level, the current classifier will be deleted, and the algorithm will use new data to train a new classifier so as to learn new concept. The experimental results showed DELM could improve the accuracy of classification result, and can adapt to new concept in a short time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) has drawn insensitive research attentions due to its effectiveness in solving many machine learning problems. However, the matrix inversion operation involved in the algorithm is computational prohibitive and limits the wide applications of ELM in many scenarios. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose an inverse-free ELM to incrementally increase the number of hidden nodes, and update the connection weights progressively and optimally. Theoretical analysis proves the monotonic decrease of the training error with the proposed updating procedure and also proves the optimality in every updating step. Extensive numerical experiments show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

AB In recent years, deep learning caves out a research wave in machine learning. With outstanding performance, more and more applications of deep learning in pattern recognition, image recognition, speech recognition, and video processing have been developed. Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) plays an important role in current deep learning techniques, as most of existing deep networks are based on or related to it. For regular RBM, the relationships between visible units and hidden units are restricted to be constants. This restriction will certainly downgrade the representation capability of the RBM. To avoid this flaw and enhance deep learning capability, the fuzzy restricted Boltzmann machine (FRBM) and its learning algorithm are proposed in this paper, in which the parameters governing the model are replaced by fuzzy numbers. This way, the original RBM becomes a special case in the FRBM, when there is no fuzziness in the FRBM model. In the process of learning FRBM, the fuzzy free energy function is defuzzified before the probability is defined. The experimental results based on bar-and-stripe benchmark inpainting and MNIST handwritten digits classification problems show that the representation capability of FRBM model is significantly better than the traditional RBM. Additionally, the FRBM also reveals better robustness property compared with RBM when the training data are contaminated by noises.

AB When user-generated data such as audio and video signals are used to train machine learning algorithms, users' privacy must be considered before the learned model is released. In this work, we present an open-source library for privacy-preserving machine learning framework on smart devices. The library allows Android and iOS devices to collectively learn a common classifier/regression model from distributed data with differential privacy, using a variant of minibatch stochastic gradient descent method. The library allows researchers and developers to easily implement and deploy customized tasks that use on-device sensors to collect sensitive data for machine learning.

AB Relation learning is a fundamental problem in many vision tasks. Recently, high-order Boltzmann machine and its variants have shown their great potentials in learning various types of data relation in a range of tasks. But most of these models are learned in an unsupervised way, i.e., without using relation class labels, which are not very discriminative for some challenging tasks, e.g., face verification. In this paper, with the goal to perform supervised relation learning, we introduce relation class labels into conventional high-order multiplicative interactions with pairwise input samples, and propose a conditional high-order Boltzmann Machine (CHBM), which can learn to classify the data relation in a binary classification way. To be able to deal with more complex data relation, we develop two improved variants of CHBM: 1) latent CHBM, which jointly performs relation feature learning and classification, by using a set of latent variables to block the pathway from pairwise input samples to output relation labels and 2) gated CHBM, which untangles factors of variation in data relation, by exploiting a set of latent variables to multiplicatively gate the classification of CHBM. To reduce the large number of model parameters generated by the multiplicative interactions, we approximately factorize high-order parameter tensors into multiple matrices. Then, we develop efficient supervised learning algorithms, by first pretraining the models using joint likelihood to provide good parameter initialization, and then finetuning them using conditional likelihood to enhance the discriminant ability. We apply the proposed models to a series of tasks including invariant recognition, face verification, and action similarity labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that by exploiting supervised relation labels, our models can greatly improve the performance.

AB Recently, there has been an ever-increasing interest in the study of data-driven analytics to predict hidden dangers in the cloud service-based coal mine production, with the purpose of the prevention of possible accidents. In this paper, to achieve the above prediction, a machine learning algorithm based on the single-hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) using timeliness managing extreme learning machine (TMELM) is utilized. Compared with those traditional learning algorithms, extreme learning machine (ELM) has its unique feature of a higher generalization capability at a much faster learning speed. In addition, the timeliness managing ELM has been proposed by incorporating timeliness management scheme into ELM approach. Under the timeliness managing ELM scheme used to predict the hidden dangers, the newly incremental data could be prior to the historical data while maximizing the contribution of the newly increasing training data, since it may be more feasible that the incremental data can contribute reasonable weights to represent the current production situation in accordance with the practical analysis for accidents in coal mine production. The experimental results on the coal mines of Beijing show that by using timeliness managing ELM, the prediction accuracy of hidden danger can be improved with better stability compared with other similar machine learning methods.

AB Precise estimation of evapotranspiration is crucial for accurate crop-water estimation. Recently machine learning (ML) techniques like artificial neural network (ANN) are being widely used for modeling the process of evapotranspiration. However, ANN faces issues like trapping in local minima, slow learning and tuning of meta-parameters. In this study an improved extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm was used to estimate weekly reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). The study was carried out for Jodhpur and Pali meteorological weather stations located in the Thar Desert, India. The study evaluated the performance of three different input combinations. The first input combination used locally available maximum and minimum air temperature data while the second and third combination used ETo values from another station (extrinsic inputs) along with the locally available temperature data as inputs. The performance of ELM models was compared with the empirical Hargreaves equation, ANN and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models. Root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) and threshold statistics (TS) were used for comparing the performance of the models. The performance of ELM model was found to be better than the Hargreaves and ANN model. The LS-SVM and ELM displayed similar performance. ELM3 models, with 36 and 33 neurons in hidden layer were found to be the best models (RMSE of 0.43 for Jodhpur and 0.33 for Pali station) for estimating weekly ETo at Jodhpur and Pali stations respectively. The results showed that ELM is a simple yet efficient algorithm which exhibited good performance; hence, can be recommended for estimating weekly ETo. Furthermore, it was also found that use of ETo values from another station can help in improving the efficiency of ML models in limited data scenario. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DAILY PRECIPITATION MODELS
AB Regression problems provide some of the most challenging research opportunities in the area of machine learning, and more broadly intelligent systems, where the predictions of some target variables are critical to a specific application. Rainfall is a prime example, as it exhibits unique characteristics of high volatility and chaotic patterns that do not exist in other time series data. This work's main impact is to show the benefit machine learning algorithms, and more broadly intelligent systems have over the current state-of-the-art techniques for rainfall prediction within rainfall derivatives. We apply and compare the predictive performance of the current state-of-the-art (Markov chain extended with rainfall prediction) and six other popular machine learning algorithms, namely: Genetic Programming, Support Vector Regression, Radial Basis Neural Networks, M5 Rules, M5 Model trees, and k-Nearest Neighbours. To assist in the extensive evaluation, we run tests using the rainfall time series across data sets for 42 cities, with very diverse climatic features. This thorough examination shows that the machine learning methods are able to outperform the current state-of-the-art. Another contribution of this work is to detect correlations between different climates and predictive accuracy. Thus, these results show the positive effect that machine learning-based intelligent systems have for predicting rainfall based on predictive accuracy and with minimal correlations existing across climates.

AB Machine learning algorithms are widely used for traffic classification and anomaly detection nowadays, however, how to fast and accurately classify the flows remains extremely challengeable. In this paper, we propose an extreme learning machine (ELM) based algorithm called L1-Norm Minimization ELM, which fully inherits the merits of ELM, and meanwhile, exhibits the sparsity-induced characteristics which could reduce the complexity of learning model. At the evaluation stage, we preprocessed the raw data trace from trans-Pacific backbone link between Japan and the United States, and generated 248 features datasets. The empirical study shows that Li-ELM can achieve good generalization performance on the evaluation datasets, while preserving the fast learning and little human intervened advantages that ELM has.

AB Most statistical models assume linearity and few variable interactions, even though real-world ecological patterns often result from nonlinear and highly interactive processes. We here introduce a set of novel empirical modeling techniques which can address this mismatch: statistically reinforced machine learning. We demonstrate the behaviors of three techniques (conditional inference tree, model-based tree, and permutation-based random forest) by analyzing an artificially generated example dataset that contains patterns based on nonlinearity and variable interactions. The results show the potential of statistically reinforced machine learning algorithms to detect nonlinear relationships and higher-order interactions. Estimation reliability for any technique, however, depended on sample size. The applications of statistically reinforced machine learning approaches would be particularly beneficial for investigating (1) novel patterns for which shapes cannot be assumed a priori, (2) higher-order interactions which are often overlooked in parametric statistics, (3) context dependency where patterns change depending on other conditions, (4) significance and effect sizes of variables while taking nonlinearity and variable interactions into account, and (5) a hypothesis using parametric statistics after identifying patterns using statistically reinforced machine learning techniques.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Face image based age estimation is an approach to classify face images into one of several pre-defined age-groups. It is challenging because facial aging variation is specific to a given individual and is determined by the person's gene and many external factors, such as exposure, weather, gender, and living style. Age estimation is a multiclass problem and the number of classes to predict is quite large. There surely is facial aging trend and faces from closed age range have some similar facial aging features. It is difficult to say there are distinct facial aging features for an age. Facial aging features are found to be overlapped among nearby age groups along the aging life and are continuous in nature. In this paper, we emphasised our work on age range estimation with four pre-defined classes. We applied a fast and efficient machine learning method: extreme learning machines, to solve the age categorization problem. Local Gabor Binary Patterns, Biologically Inspired Feature and Gabor were adopted to represent face image. Age estimation was performed on three different aging datasets and experimental results are reported to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness. (C) 2014 Elsevier ay. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Re-ranking; Extreme learning machine; Scaled sorted classification
   re-ranking; Statistical machine translation
AB In statistical machine translation (SMT), a possibly infinite number of translation hypotheses can be decoded from a source sentence, among which re-ranking is applied to sort out the best translation result. Undoubtedly, re-ranking is an essential component of SMT for effective and efficient translation. A novel re-ranking method called Scaled Sorted Classification Re-ranking (SSCR) based on extreme learning machine (ELM) classification and minimum error rate training (MERT) is proposed. SSCR contains four steps: (1) the input features are normalized to the range of 0 to 1; (2) an ELM classification model is constructed for hypothesis ranking; (3) each translation hypothesis is ranked using the ELM classification model; and (4) the highest ranked subset of hypotheses are selected, in which the hypothesis with best predicted score based on MERT (system score) is returned as the final translation result. Compared with the baseline score (lower bound), SSCR with ELM classification can raise the translation quality up to 6.7% in IWSLT 2014 Chinese to English corpus. Compared with the state-of-the-art rank boosting, SSCR has a relatively 7.8% of improvement on BLEU in a larger WMT 2015 English-to-French corpus. Moreover, the training time of the proposed method is about 160 times faster than traditional regression-based re-ranking.

AB Due to high volume, velocity, and variety (referred to as "3V") of data production, the term "big data" has recently emerged. Because of such fast data growth, Data centers of educational institutions are seemingly exploding as well. Therefore, big data is making its way to the field of E-learning. Nowadays large educational institutions feel the urgent need to analyze this flood of data to provide students with higher quality of services. Despite the fact that there is huge volume and variety of data with high velocity of production, the existing traditional methods are unable to analyze such data. In other words, there is little done on implementing learning analytics on big data engines. The author created a scalable machine learning system on a cluster of three machines suitable for large dataset operations using big data engine and implemented an early warning process with machine learning techniques. The dataset was obtained from online and semionline courses from The University of Tehran. Many features like access time, history of access and history of actions of students were extracted and used for the classification task. A parallel distributed classification process was run to predict students' success and failures. It offers a fast, scalable and in-memory process with apache Spark. Eventually, the research compares the efficiency of proposed method with current and common methods'. The results reveal that our model had a high classification accuracy and the larger the dataset, the more efficient our process will be. It also discusses a new term "learning analytic" and "big data" that are completely new and worth reading. My paper contains worthy information about implementing ELearning data mining on big data engines.

AB Numerical optimization is a classical field in operation research and computer science, which has been widely used in the areas such as physics and economics. Although, optimization algorithms have achieved great success for plenty of applications, handling the big data in the best fashion possible is a very inspiring and demanding challenge in the artificial intelligence era. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is pretty simple but surprisingly, highly effective in machine learning models, such as support vector machine (SVM) and deep neural network (DNN). Theoretically, the performance of SGD for convex optimization is well understood. But, for the non-convex setting, which is very common for the machine learning problems, to obtain the theoretical guarantee for SGD and its variants is still a standing problem. In the paper, we do a survey about the SGD and its variants such as Momentum, ADAM and SVRG, differentiate their algorithms and applications and present some recent breakthrough and open problems.

AB Machine learning has become a pivotal tool for many projects in computational biology, bioinformatics, and health informatics. Nevertheless, beginners and biomedical researchers often do not have enough experience to run a data mining project effectively, and therefore can follow incorrect practices, that may lead to common mistakes or over-optimistic results. With this review, we present ten quick tips to take advantage of machine learning in any computational biology context, by avoiding some common errors that we observed hundreds of times in multiple bioinformatics projects. We believe our ten suggestions can strongly help any machine learning practitioner to carry on a successful project in computational biology and related sciences.

TI Mortality risk prediction in burn injury: Comparison of logistic

SO BURNS
LA English
DT Article
DE Machine learning; Burn; Mortality; Clinical prediction
ID SURVIVAL
AB Introduction: Predicting mortality from burn injury has traditionally employed logistic regression models. Alternative machine learning methods have been introduced in some areas of clinical prediction as the necessary software and computational facilities have become accessible. Here we compare logistic regression and machine learning predictions of mortality from burn.
   Methods: An established logistic mortality model was compared to machine learning methods (artificial neural network, support vector machine, random forests and naive Bayes) using a population-based (England & Wales) case-cohort registry. Predictive evaluation used: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; sensitivity; specificity; positive predictive value and Youden's index.
   Results: All methods had comparable discriminatory abilities, similar sensitivities, specificities and positive predictive values. Although some machine learning methods performed marginally better than logistic regression the differences were seldom statistically significant and clinically insubstantial. Random forests were marginally better for high positive predictive value and reasonable sensitivity. Neural networks yielded slightly better prediction overall. Logistic regression gives an optimal mix of performance and interpretability.
   Discussion: The established logistic regression model of burn mortality performs well against more complex alternatives. Clinical prediction with a small set of strong, stable, independent predictors is unlikely to gain much from machine learning outside specialist research contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and its variants have been widely used in many big data learning applications where raw data with imbalanced class distribution can be easily found. Although there have been several works solving the machine learning and robust regression problems using MapReduce framework, they need multi-iterative computations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Distributed Weighted Extreme Learning Machine based on MapReduce framework, named DWELM, which can learn the big imbalanced training data efficiently. Firstly, after indepth analyzing the properties of centralized Weighted ELM (WELM), it can be found out that the matrix multiplication operators in WELM are decomposable. Next, a DWELM based on MapReduce framework can be developed, which can first calculate the matrix multiplications effectively using two MapReduce Jobs in parallel, and then calculate the corresponding output weight vector with centralized computing. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic data to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed DWELM in learning big imbalanced training data with various experimental settings.

DE Gist feature; Extreme Learning Machine; scene classification
AB At present, with the expanding of the image database, scene classification based on machine learning gained much more attention among insiders. But this problem poses many difficult challenges. To overcome these challenges, we have to find a proper feature and an effective classifier. Some research found that Gist feature matches with the action of human visual system perfectly. Some scholars chose Support Vector Machine (SVM) to be the classifier, but when doing multi-class classification, method using SVM tends to be complicated and sensitive to the variation of parameters. Our work proposed a new scene classification method using Gist feature and generating classifier with Extreme Learning Machine. By testing our algorithm and comparing it with method using SVM, we demonstrated that our algorithm is effective and feasible, and have much more stable performance than SVM method.

AB Falls are common and dangerous for the elderly or individuals with decreased independence or functional limitations. Fall recognition is extremely important for fallers, healthcare providers, and society. Immediate fall recognition triggers emergency services and potentially decreases individuals time with injury without care. Acute post-fall intervention works to mitigate life threatening fall consequences, decrease fall risk through rehabilitation, and improve quality of life. Extended from our research on real-time fall risk estimation with the functional reach test and Timed Up and Go test built in mStroke, a real-time and automatic mobile health system for post-stroke recovery and rehabilitation, our investigation here is expanded to include fall recognition by taking advantage of wearable technologies and machine learning algorithms. Up to three wearable sensors are employed to acquire raw motion data related to activities of daily living or falls. Feature selection and classification on the basis of machine learning algorithms are explored for fall recognition. The fall recognition performances are presented to justify their accuracy and reliability. Meanwhile, the effects of sensor placement/ location and the feature number on the recognition performance are also discussed in this paper.

ID RECOGNITION; REGRESSION
AB The concentration of alumina in the electrolyte is of great significance during the production of aluminum. The amount of the alumina concentration may lead to unbalanced material distribution and low production efficiency and affect the stability of the aluminum reduction cell and current efficiency. The existing methods cannot meet the needs for online measurement because industrial aluminum electrolysis has the characteristics of high temperature, strong magnetic field, coupled parameters, and high nonlinearity. Currently, there are no sensors or equipment that can detect the alumina concentration on line. Most companies acquire the alumina concentration from the electrolyte samples which are analyzed through an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. To solve the problem, the paper proposes a soft sensing model based on a kernel extreme learning machine algorithm that takes the kernel function into the extreme learning machine. K-fold cross validation is used to estimate the generalization error. The proposed soft sensing algorithm can detect alumina concentration by the electrical signals such as voltages and currents of the anode rods. The predicted results show that the proposed approach can give more accurate estimations of alumina concentration with faster learning speed compared with the other methods such as the basic ELM, BP, and SVM.

AB Identification and classification of graph data is a hot research issue in pattern recognition. The conventional methods of graph classification usually convert the graph data to the vector representation and then using SVM to be a classifier. These methods ignore the sparsity of graph data, and with the increase of the input sample, the storage and computation of the kernel matrix will cost a lot of memory and time. In this paper, we propose a new graph classification algorithm called graph classification based on sparse graph feature selection and extreme learning machine. The key of our method is using the lasso to select features because of the sparsity of graph data, and extreme learning machine (ELM) is introduced to the following classification task due to its good performance. Extensive experimental results on a series of benchmark graph data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The best results found for many optimization problems in science and industry are obtained by hybrid optimization algorithms. Combinations of optimization tools such as metaheuristics, mathematical programming, constraint programming and machine learning, have provided very efficient optimization algorithms. Four different types of combinations are considered in this paper: (1) Combining metaheuristics with complementary metaheuristics. (2) Combining metaheuristics with exact methods from mathematical programming approaches which are mostly used in the operations research community. (3) Combining metaheuristics with constraint programming approaches developed in the artificial intelligence community. (4) Combining metaheuristics with machine learning and data mining techniques.

AB Forecasting the output power of solar systems is required for the good operation of the power grid or for the optimal management of the energy fluxes occurring into the solar system. Before forecasting the solar systems output, it is essential to focus the prediction on the solar irradiance. The global solar radiation forecasting can be performed by several methods; the two big categories are the cloud imagery combined with physical models, and the machine learning models. In this context, the objective of this paper is to give an overview of forecasting methods of solar irradiation using machine learning approaches. Although, a lot of papers describes methodologies like neural networks or support vector regression, it will be shown that other methods (regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting and many others) begin to be used in this context of prediction. The performance ranking of such methods is complicated due to the diversity of the data set, time step, forecasting horizon, set up and performance indicators. Overall, the error of prediction is quite equivalent. To improve the prediction performance some authors proposed the use of hybrid models or to use an ensemble forecast approach.

AB Recently, there are several multilinear methods have been proposed for tensorial data dimensionality reduction (feature extraction). However, there are few new algorithms for tensorial signals classification. To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel classifier as a tensor extension of extreme learning machine for multi-dimensional data recognition is introduced. Due to the proposed solution can classify tensorial data directly without vectorizing them, the intrinsic structure information of the input data can be reserved. Moreover, compared with the traditional ELM, much fewer parameters need to be calculated through the proposed tensor based classifier. Extensive experiments are carried out on different databases, and the experiment results are compared against state-of-the-art techniques. It is demonstrated that the new tensor based classifier can get better recognition performance with an extremely fast learning speed.

DE large-scale machine learning; end-to-end platform; continuous training
AB Creating and maintaining a platform for reliably producing and deploying machine learning models requires careful orchestration of many components a learner for generating models based on training data, modules for analyzing and validating both data as well as models, and finally infrastructure for serving models in production. This becomes particularly challenging when data changes over time and fresh models need to be produced continuously. Unfortunately, such orchestration is often done ad hoc using glue code and custom scripts developed by individual teams for specific use cases, leading to duplicated effort and fragile systems with high technical debt.
   We present TensorFlow Extended (TFX), a TensorFlow-based general-purpose machine learning platform implemented at Google. By integrating the aforementioned components into one platform, we were able to standardize the components, simplify the platform configuration, and reduce the time to production from the order of months to weeks, while providing platform stability that minimizes disruptions.
   We present the case study of one deployment of TFX in the Google Play app store, where the machine learning models are refreshed continuously as new data arrive. Deploying TFX led to reduced custom code, faster experiment cycles, and a 2% increase in app installs resulting from improved data and model analysis.

DE Extreme learning machine; dialect classification; speech variability
AB It is well known that the variability in speech caused by the accents or dialects of speakers degrades the performance of speech recognition systems. One method to prevent this degradation is to correctly identify the accent or dialect of a speaker so that the putative system can be designed to use this information. In this paper, we apply the extreme learning machine, an efficient neural network learning algorithm, to the problem of accent/dialect classification on the TIMIT dataset. Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) and the normalized energy parameter are computed from word samples in each dialect class, and these along with their first and second derivatives are used as training features. A novel architecture and a weighting scheme are used to classify North American dialects into seven groups. Using this technique, we obtain an classification accuracy of 76.92%, which to our knowledge is the best result reported for dialect classification on the TIMIT dataset.

AB Bandwidth demand forecasting is the basis and foundation of the power communication network planning. In view of the traditional neural network learning speed is slow, the number of iterations is large, and the local optimal problem, an adaptive extreme learning machine model based on the theory of extreme learning machine and K nearest neighbor theory is proposed to predict the bandwidth of electric power communication. The adaptive metrics of inputs can solve the problems of amplitude changing and trend determination, and reduce the effect of the overfitting of networks. The proposed algorithms are validated using real data of a province in China. The results show that this method is better than the traditional neural network, auto regressive model, self organization model, and single extreme learning machine model. It can be used in electric power communication bandwidth prediction.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM), as one of the most useful techniques in machine learning, has attracted extensive attentions due to its unique ability for extremely fast learning. In particular, it is widely recognized that ELM has speed advantage while performing satisfying results. However, the presence of outliers may give rise to unreliable ELM model. In this paper, our study addresses the outlier robustness of ELM in regression problems. Based on the sparsity characteristic of outliers, this work proposes an outlier-robust ELM where the l(1)-norm loss function is used to enhance the robustness. Specially, the fast and accurate augmented Iagrangian multiplier method is applied to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency. According to the experiments on function approximation and some real-world applications, the proposed approach not only maintains the advantages from original ELM, but also shows notable and stable accuracy in handling data with outliers.

AB Artificial intelligence is currently in the center of attention of legal professionals. In recent years, a variety of efforts have been made to predict judicial decisions using different machine learning models, but no realistic performance comparison between them is available. In this paper, we conducted experiments comparing five well-known machine learning models: k-NN, logistic regression, bagging, random forests and SVM. Our experimental results show that the SVM model outperforms the other models over all the different settings, and the semantic information of the text in cases plays an important role in selecting features for the predicting models.

AB In this paper we approach from a machine learning perspective the problem of identifying the sex of archaeological remains from anthropometric data, an important problem within the field of bioarchaeology. As the conditions for detecting the sex of a skeleton are not entirely known, machine learning based data mining models are appropriate to address this problem since they are able to capture unobservable patterns in data. These patterns could be relevant for classifying a skeletal remain as male or female. We propose two machine learning models based on artificial neural networks for identifying the sex of human skeletons from bone measurements. The proposed models are experimentally evaluated on case studies generated from two data sets publicly available in the archaeological literature. The obtained results show that the proposed data mining models are effective for detecting the sex of archaeological remains, confirming the potential of our proposal.

AB Today we have unprecedented access to datasets bearing huge potential in regard to both business and research. However, beside their unquestionable utility, privacy breaches pose a significant risk to the release of these datasets (e.g., datasets originating from healthcare are good examples), thus service providers must use anonymization techniques to minimize the risk of unwanted disclosure. In this study, we focus on de-anonymization attacks, algorithms that are designed to "reverse" the anonymization process. In particular, we focus on a novel segment of these attacks that involve machine learning to improve robustness and efficiency. Furthermore, we highlight and discuss the similarity between de-anonymization and authentication: how can these algorithms, which are generally perceived as unethical, be used legitimately for security reasons under special constraints.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to investigate the goals and variables employed in the machine learning and microsimulation studies for the prognosis of dementia.
   METHOD: According to preset protocols, the Pubmed, Socups and Web of Science databases were searched to find studies that matched the defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and then its references were checked for new studies. A quality checklist assessed the selected studies, and removed the low quality ones. The remaining ones (included set) had their data extracted and summarized.
   RESULTS: The summary of the data of the 37 included studies showed that the most common goal of the selected studies was the prediction of the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's Disease, for studies that used machine learning, and cost estimation for the microsimulation ones. About the variables, neuroimaging was the most frequent used.
   CONCLUSIONS: The systematic literature review showed clear trends in prognosis of dementia research in what concerns machine learning techniques and microsimulation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Unpredictability of solar resource poses difficulties in grid management as solar diffusion rates rise continuously. One of the big challenges with integrating renewables into the grid is that their power generation is intermittent and unruly. Thus, the task of solar power forecasting becomes vital to ensure grid constancy and to enable an optimal unit commitment and cost-effective dispatch. Latest techniques and approaches arise worldwide each year to progress accuracy of models with the vital aim of reducing uncertainty in the predictions. This paper appears with the aim of compiling a big part of the knowledge about solar power forecasting, focusing on the most recent advancements and future trends. Firstly, the inspiration to achieve an accurate forecast is presented with the analysis of the economic implications it may have. To address the problem and we rummage superlative prediction models for forecasting solar radiation using machine learning techniques. We compare multiple regression techniques for generating prediction models, including linear least squares and support vector machines using multiple kernel functions. In our experiments, we analyze predictions for day ahead solar radiation data and show that a machine learning approach yields feasible results for short-term solar power prediction. A root mean square error improvement of around 32% is achieved by the proposed model compared to others proposed reference model except one.

AB The theory and computational tools developed to interpret and explore energy landscapes in molecular science are applied to the landscapes defined by local minima for neural networks. These machine learning landscapes correspond to fits of training data, where the inputs are vital signs and laboratory measurements for a database of patients, and the objective is to predict a clinical outcome. In this contribution, we test the predictions obtained by fitting to single measurements, and then to combinations of between 2 and 10 different patient medical data items. The effect of including measurements over different time intervals from the 48 h period in question is analysed, and the most recent values are found to be the most important. We also compare results obtained for neural networks as a function of the number of hidden nodes, and for different values of a regularization parameter. The predictions are compared with an alternative convex fitting function, and a strong correlation is observed. The dependence of these results on the patients randomly selected for training and testing decreases systematically with the size of the database available. The machine learning landscapes defined by neural network fits in this investigation have single-funnel character, which probably explains why it is relatively straightforward to obtain the global minimum solution, or a fit that behaves similarly to this optimal parameterization.

AB Agarwood oil is known as one of the most expensive and precious oils being traded. It is widely used in traditional ceremonies and religious prayers. Its quality plays an important role on the market price that it can be traded. This paper proposes on a proper classification method of the agarwood oil quality using machine learning model k-nearest neighbour (k-NN). The chemical compounds of the agarwood oil from high and low quality are used to train and build the k-NN classifier model. Correlation-based feature selection was used to reduce the dimension of the data before it is being fed into the model. The results show a very high accuracy (100%) model trained and can be used to classify the agarwood oil quality accurately.

AB An ontology is a taxonomic hierarchy of lexical terms and their syntactic and semantic relations for representing a framework of structured knowledge. Ontology used to be problem-specific and manually built due to its extreme complexity. Based on the latest advances in cognitive knowledge learning and formal semantic analyses, an Algorithm of Formal Ontology Generation (AFOG) is developed. The methodology of AFOG enables autonomous generation of quantitative ontologies in knowledge engineering and semantic comprehension via deep machine learning. A set of experiments demonstrates applications of AFOG in cognitive computing, semantic computing, machine learning and computational intelligence.

AB Many time series problems such as air pollution index forecast require online sequential learning rather than batch learning. One of the major obstacles for air pollution index forecast is the data imbalance problem so that forecast model biases to the majority class. This paper proposes a new method called meta-cognitive online sequential extreme learning machine (MCOS-ELM) that aims to alleviate data imbalance problem and sequential learning at the same time. Under a real application of air pollution index forecast, the proposed MCOS-ELM was compared with retrained ELM and online sequential extreme learning machine in terms of accuracy and computational time. Experimental results show that MCOS-ELM has the highest efficiency and best accuracy for predicting the minority class (i.e., the most important but with fewest training samples) of air pollution level.

AB Integrity of pipelines transporting hydrocarbons over long distances is a growing and challenging problem for Oil&Gas companies, since the age of plants and components is worldwide increasing. Internal corrosion is one of the most dangerous damage mechanisms active in pipelines. Since it is due to interaction of different mechanisms, a large degree of uncertainty is associated with the attempt of quantifying a prediction for the future evolution of damage. Existing models rarely reproduce field data. Given high nonlinearity of the corrosion process, a Machine Learning approach has been investigated, focusing on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In particular, an ensemble of ANNs is generated. This strategy strongly improves the results obtained not only by deterministic models, usually considered in literature, but also by single ANN models. Given the high uncertainty inherent to real internal corrosion problem, results from Machine Learning approach are promising.

AB Machine learning methods are frequently used for data sets in many fields including medicine for purposes of feature extraction and pattern recognition. This study includes lesion data obtained from Magnetic Resonance images taken in three different years and belonging to 120 individuals (with 76 RRMS, 6 PPMS, 38 SPMS). Many alternative methods are used nowadays to be able to find out the strong and distinctive features of Multiple Sclerosis based on MR images. Deep learning has the working capacity pertaining to a much wider scaled space (120 x 228), less dimension (50 x 228) (also referred to as distinctive) feature space and SVM (120 x 228). Deep learning has formed a more skillful system in the classification of MS subgroups by working with fewer sets of features compared to SVM algorithm. Deep learning algorithm has a better accuracy rate in comparing the MS subgroups compared to multiclass SVM algorithm kernel types which are among the conventional machine learning systems.

AB This paper proposes model rotation as a general approach to parallelize big data machine learning applications. To solve the big model problem in parallelization, we distribute the model parameters to inter-node workers and rotate different model parts in a ring topology. The advantage of model rotation comes from maximizing the effect of parallel model updates for algorithm convergence while minimizing the overhead of communication. We formulate a solution using computation models, programming interfaces, and system implementations as design principles and derive a machine learning framework with three algorithms built on top of it: Latent Dirichlet Allocation using Collapsed Gibbs Sampling, Matrix Factorization using Stochastic Gradient Descent and Cyclic Coordinate Descent. The performance results on an Intel Haswell cluster with max 60 nodes show that our solution achieves faster model convergence speed and higher scalability than previous work by others.

AB In the proposed paper, we consider a problem of text detection in document images. This problem plays an important role in OCR systems and is a challenging task. In the first step of our proposed text detection approach, we use a self-adjusting bottom-up segmentation algorithm to segment a document image into a set of connected components (CCs). The segmentation algorithm is based on the Sobel edge detection method. In the second step, CCs are described in terms of 27 features and a machine learning algorithm is then used to classify the CCs as text or nontext. For testing the approach, we have collected a dataset (ASTRoID), which contains 500 images of text blocks and 500 images of nontext blocks. We empirically compare performance of the proposed text detection method when using seven different machine learning algorithms.

AB Smart materials are of growing interest in research as well as industry due to its wide range of possible applications. Combined with a mass production enabled manufacturing of these materials, its application is further increased. A current research project addresses the integration of piezo ceramic elements into metal sheets to develop a smart touch-alike input device. The aim is to develop a low-cost embedded processing system that is able to compute the origin of impacts affecting the material surface. In this paper, the usability of machine learning algorithms to be used for adaptive impact detection and localization is evaluated. Data generated by suitable data pre-processing techniques is applied to neural networks, support vector machines and extreme learning machines for evaluation.

AB Cervical cancer (Ca Cervix) is serious public health problem in women in the world. Fortunately, this disease is preventable. Current prevention method remains low both in the result and participation. So, prevention or early detection method still open and challenging. Behavior and its determinant are promising as Ca Cervix predictor and event as early detection. To date, there is still limited amount of research conducted in Ca Cervix detection based on behavior and machine learning in the combination of the field of public health and computer science. In this study, machine learning is used as classifier to detect the probability of Ca Cervix risk based on behavior and its determinant. Two popular machine learning, Na ve Bayes (NB) and Logistic Regression (LR) are used as classifier. From the experimental result, both NB and LR are promising as classifier to detect Ca Cervix risk based on behavior and its determinant with accuracy 91.67% and 87.5% respectively and with AUC 0.96 and 0.97 respectively.

DE Classification; Regularized extreme learning machine; Symbiotic
   Organisms Search
AB In this paper, a novel data classification approach is proposed based on integration of regularized extreme learning machine and Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS). In order to simplified the description, the new method is named as Sos-RELM, which mainly contains two phases. As is known, in compared with traditional classification paths, such as SVM, LS-SVM and BP, extreme learning machine expresses its excellent ability in term of accuracy and computing time. Hence, in the first phase, we utilize regularised extreme learning machine with the goal that the output weights can be rapidly calculated. Symbiotic Organisms Search is one of new metaheuristic algorithms with various operations to update the individuals, which outperform DE, GA, and PSO. According to this effective and efficient optimization approach, in the second phase, the set of input wights, hidden biases and regularization parameter are optimized using Symbiotic Organisms Search. And the experimental results indicates that Sos-RELM attain a good comprehensive performance.

AB A pseudo-random generator is an algorithm to generate a sequence of objects determined by a truly random seed which is not truly random. It has been widely used in many applications, such as cryptography and simulations. In this article, we examine current popular machine learning algorithms with various on-line algorithms for pseudo-random generated data in order to find out which machine learning approach is more suitable for this kind of data for prediction based on on-line algorithms. To further improve the prediction performance, we propose a novel sample weighted algorithm that takes generalization errors in each iteration into account. We perform intensive evaluation on real Baccarat data generated by Casino machines and random number generated by a popular Java program, which are two typical examples of pseudo-random generated data. The experimental results show that support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors have better performance than others with and without sample weighted algorithm in the evaluation data set.

After segmenting a text in its elementary discourse units, the detection of the central unit is a crucial step on the way to robustly build discourse trees under the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Besides, CU detection may also be useful in automatic summarization, question answering and sentiment analysis tasks. Results show that the CU detection using machine learning techniques for Basque scientific abstracts outperform rule based techniques, even on a small size corpus on different domains. This leads us to think that there is still room for improvement.

AB Forecasting energy consumption in buildings is a key step towards the realization of optimized energy production, distribution and consumption. This paper presents a data driven approach for analysis and forecast of aggregate space and water thermal load in buildings. The analysis and the forecast models are built using district heating data unobtrusively collected from 10 residential and commercial buildings located in Skellefte (a) over circle, Sweden. The load forecast models are generated using supervised machine learning techniques, namely, support vector machine, regression tree, feed forward neural network, and multiple linear regression. The model takes the outdoor temperature, historical values of heat load, time factor variables and physical parameters of district heating substations as its input. A performance comparison among the machine learning methods and identification of the importance of models input variables is carried out. The models are evaluated with varying forecast horizons of every hour from 1 up to 48 h. Our results show that support vector machine, feed forward neural network and multiple linear regression are more suitable machine learning methods with lower Performance errors than the regression tree. Support vector machine has the least normalized root mean square error of 0.07 for a forecast horizon of 24 h. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the construction and implementation process on an FPGA platform of an objective perceived image quality, using an objective image quality assessment (IQA) method. This objective IQA uses machine learning (ML) methods to construct the models upon the features extracted from different concepts: the natural scene statistic (NSS) in spatial domain, the gradient magnitude (GM), the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), as well as the spectral and spatial entropies. The training phase to estimate the image quality is performed by a learning which uses two training phases to predict the objective image quality; the first to train the intermediary metrics using the classes of independent features, and the second to evaluate the image quality using the intermediary metrics. The Implementation phase on an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform is tested on Xilinx Virtex 7 (VC707) FPGA board, and implemented using C/C++ code on Xilinx Vivado HLS.

We studied how accurately we can automatically classify requirements as functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) in the dataset with supervised machine learning. Furthermore, we assessed how accurately we can identify various types of NFRs, in particular usability, security, operational, and performance requirements.
   We developed and evaluated a supervised machine learning approach employing meta-data, lexical, and syntactical features. We employed under- and over-sampling strategies to handle the imbalanced classes in the dataset and cross-validated the classifiers using precision, recall, and F1 metrics in a series of experiments based on the Support Vector Machine classifier algorithm. We achieve a precision and recall up to similar to 92% for automatically identifying FRs and NFRs. For the identification of specific NFRs, we achieve the highest precision and recall for security and performance NFRs with similar to 92% precision and similar to 90% recall. We discuss the most discriminating features of FRs and NFRs as well as the sampling strategies used with an additional dataset and their impact on the classification accuracy.

ID DYNAMIC WEIGHTING ENSEMBLES; DECOMPOSITION; ALGORITHM
AB This paper proposes an adaptive incremental ensemble of extreme learning machines for fault diagnosis. The diagnostic system contains a data processing unit which aims to progressively generate discriminant features from the vibration signals for decision making. The decision making unit receives a few sets of labeled discriminant features in a chunk by chunk manner, incrementally learns the features-faults relations, dynamically diagnoses multiple bearing defects, and adaptively adjusts itself to learn new concept classes. This adaptive ensemble system is based on incremental learning of multiple extreme learning machines that are able to consult together and adjust themselves based on their confidence in the decision making. Extreme learning machines are used to construct the hybrid ensemble due to their good controllability and fast learning rate. Experimental results show the efficiency of the hybrid diagnostic system. The proposed diagnostic system is applied to diagnosing bearing defects in an induction motor.

   index
AB In engineering, the method of wind speed vertical extrapolation is based on the actual wind data of the wind tower, and the wind shear index is used to calculate the wind speed at any height in the near ground. The wind shear index is only considered in the neutral state of the atmosphere, without considering the impact of atmospheric stability on the wind shear index, which has some limitations. At the same time, the calculation of the wind shear index is a rather complicated task when considering the atmospheric stability. In order to solve these problems, this paper puts forward to use extreme learning machine for fitting the relationship between wind speed at different heights. Extreme learning machine has the advantages of fast learning speed, good generalization ability and so on. In this paper, the results obtained by the extreme learning machine and traditional methods are compared with the measured values. The results show that the extreme learning machine has a better application prospect in the vertical wind speed extrapolation.

AB The explosive growth of medical databases and the widespread development of high performance machine learning (ML) algorithms led to the search for efficient computer-aided medical diagnosis (CAMD) techniques. Automated medical diagnosis can be achieved by building a model of a certain disease under surveillance and comparing it with the real time physiological measurements taken from the patient. If this practice is carried out on a regular basis, potential risky medical conditions can be detected at an early stage, thus making the process of fighting the disease much easier. With CAMD, physicians can trustfully use the "second opinion" of the 'digital assistant' and make the final optimum decision. The recent development of intelligent technologies, designed to enhance the process of differential diagnosis by using medical databases, significantly enables the decision-making process of health professionals. Up-to-date online medical databases can now be used to support clinical decision-making, offering direct access to medical evidence. In this paper, we provide an overview on selected ML algorithms that can be applied in CAMD, focusing on the enhancement of neural networks (NNs) by hybridization, partially connectivity, and alternative learning paradigms. Particularly, we emphasize the benefits of using such effective algorithms in breast cancer detection and recurrence, colon cancer, lung cancer, liver fibrosis stadialization, heart attack, and diabetes. Generally, the aim is to provide a theme for discussions on ML-based methods applied to medicine.

ID SELECTION
AB This paper primarily addresses a dataset relating to cellular, chemical and physical conditions of patients gathered at the time they are operated upon to remove colorectal tumours. This data provides a unique insight into the biochemical and immunological status of patients at the point of tumour removal along with information about tumour classification and post-operative survival. The relationship between severity of tumour, based on TNM staging, and survival is still unclear for patients with TNM stage 2 and 3 tumours. We ask whether it is possible to predict survival rate more accurately using a selection of machine learning techniques applied to subsets of data to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between a patient's biochemical markers and survival.
   We use a range of feature selection and single classification techniques to predict the 5 year survival rate of TNM stage 2 and 3 patients which initially produces less than ideal results. The performance of each model individually is then compared with subsets of the data where agreement is reached for multiple models. This novel method of selective ensembling demonstrates that significant improvements in model accuracy on an unseen test set can be achieved for patients where agreement between models is achieved. Finally we point at a possible method to identify whether a patients prognosis can be accurately predicted or not.

AB Vertex centrality measures are important analysis elements in complex networks and systems. These metrics have high space and time complexity, which is a severe problem in applications that typically involve large networks. To apply such high complexity metrics in large networks we trained and tested off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms on several generated networks using five well-known complex network models. Our main hypothesis is that if one uses low complexity metrics as inputs to train the algorithms, one will achieve good approximations of high complexity measures. Our results show that the regression output of the machine learning algorithms applied in our experiments successfully approximate the real metric values and are a robust alternative in real world applications, in particular in complex and social network analysis.

AB In this study, we improved the usability of smartphones by automating a user's operations. We developed an intelligent system using machine learning techniques that periodically detects a user's context on a smartphone. We selected the Android operating system because it has the largest market share and highest flexibility of its development environment. In this paper, we describe an application that automatically adjusts application volume. Adjusting the volume can be easily forgotten because users need to push the volume buttons to alter the volume depending on the given situation. Therefore, we developed an application that automatically adjusts the volume based on learned user settings. Application volume can be set differently from ringtone volume on Android devices, and these volume settings are associated with each specific application including games. Our application records a user's location, the volume setting, the foreground application name and other such attributes as learning data, thereby estimating whether the volume should be adjusted using machine learning techniques via Weka.

AB The key interest of machine learning is conventionally training the machine from data that have underlying distribution such as data should have predetermined distribution. Such a constraint on the problem area leads to the technique for development of learning algorithms with notionally verifiable performance accuracy. However, real-world problems are not able to fit smartly into such restricted model. Class imbalance problem can occur due to tilted distribution of class data. Data streaming from non-stationary distribution with more uncertainty in real-time applications, resulting in the concept drift problem. In this methodology, it is proposed to extend the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm for effectively handling the class imbalance problem and concept drift in datasets. This proposal has higher level of prediction accuracy and performance compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Support Vector Data Description

AB The research presented in this paper is focused on proposing a new digital workflow, involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and machines learning systems, in order to detect and map citizen's behaviors in the context of public spaces. Novel machinic abilities can be implemented in the understanding of the human context, decoding, through computer visions and machine learning, complex systems into intelligible outputs (Olson, 2008), mapping the relationships of our reality. In this framework, robotic and computational strategies can be implemented in order to offer a new description of public spaces, bringing to light the hidden forces and multiple layers constituting the urban habitat. The presented study focuses on the development of a methodology turning video frames collected from cameras installed on drones into large datasets used to train convolutional networks and enable machines learning systems to detect and map pedestrians in public spaces.

AB Past few years have seen increase in the number of spam emails and messages. Legal, economic and technical measures can be used to tackle spam sins's nowadays. A key role is being played by Bayesian filters in stopping this problem. In this paper, we analyzed and studied the relative strengths of various machine learning algorithms in order to detect spam messages which are sent on mobile devices. We have acquired the data from on open public dataset and prepared two datasets liar our testing and validation purposes. Accuracy in detecting spam messages was the first priority in ranking these algorithms. Our results clearly demonstrate that different machine learning algorithms under different features tend to perform differently in classifying spam messages.

AB We aimed to identify optimal machine-learning methods for radiomics-based prediction of local failure and distant failure in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We enrolled 110 patients with advanced NPC. A total of 970 radiomic features were extracted from MRI images for each patient. Six feature selection methods and nine classification methods were evaluated in terms of their performance. We applied the 10 fold cross-validation as the criterion for feature selection and classification. We repeated each combination for 50 times to obtain the mean area under the curve (AUC) and test error. We observed that the combination methods Random Forest (RF) + RF (AUC, 0.8464 +/- 0.0069; test error, 03135 +/- 0.0088) had the highest prognostic performance, followed by RF + Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) (AUC, 0.8204 +/- 0.0095; test error, 0.3384 +/- 0.0097), and Sure Independence Screening (SIS) + Linear Support Vector Machines (LSVM) (AUC, 0.7883 +/- 0.0096; test error, 0.3985 +/- 0.0100). Our radiomics study identified optimal machine-learning methods for the radiomics-based prediction of local failure and distant failure in advanced NPC, which could enhance the applications of radiomics in precision oncology and clinical practice.

AB Popularity of massive online open courses (MOOCs) allowed educational researchers to address problems which were not accessible few years ago. Although classical statistical techniques still apply, large datasets allow us to discover deeper patterns and to provide more accurate predictions of student's behaviors and outcomes. The goal of this tutorial was to disseminate knowledge on elementary data analysis tools as well as facilitate simple practical data analysis activities with the purpose of stimulating reflection on the great potential of large datasets. In particular, during the tutorial we introduce elementary tools for using machine learning models in education. Although the methodology presented here applies in any programming environment, we choose R and CARET package due to simplicity and access to the most recent machine learning methods.

AB Software metrics can be used as a indicator of the presence of software vulnerabilities. These metrics have been used with machine learning to predict source code prone to contain vulnerabilities. Although it is not possible to find the exact location of the flaws, the models can show which components require more attention during inspections and testing. Each new technique uses his own evaluation dataset, which many times has limited size and representativeness. In this experience report, we use a large and representative dataset to evaluate several state of the art vulnerability prediction techniques. This dataset was built with information of 2186 vulnerabilities from five widely used open source projects. Results show that the dataset can be used to distinguish which are the best techniques. It is also shown that some of the techniques can predict nearly all of the vulnerabilities present in the dataset, although with very low precisions. Finally, accuracy, precision and recall are not the most effective to characterize the effectiveness of this tools.

AB Detecting phishing websites has been noted as complex and dynamic problem area because of the subjective considerations and ambiguities of detection mechanism. We propose a novel approach that uses Ripple-down Rule (RDR) to acquire knowledge from human experts with the modified RDR model-generating algorithm (Induct RDR), which applies machine-learning approach. The modified algorithm considers two different data types (numeric and nominal) and also applies information theory from decision tree learning algorithms. Our experimental results showed the proposing approach can help to deduct the cost of solving over-generalization and over-fitting problems of machine learning approach. Three models were included in comparison: RDR with machine learning and human knowledge, RDR machine learning only and J48 machine learning only. The result shows the improvements in prediction accuracy of the knowledge acquired by machine learning.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) is a learning paradigm that can be useful in a wide variety of real-world applications. However, its applicability to complex problems remains problematic due to different causes. Particularly important among these are the high quantity of data required by the agent to learn useful policies and the poor scalability to high-dimensional problems due to the use of local approximators. This paper presents a novel RL algorithm, called online fitted policy iteration (OFPI), that steps forward in both directions. OFPI is based on a semi-batch scheme that increases the convergence speed by reusing data and enables the use of global approximators by reformulating the value function approximation as a standard supervised problem. The proposed method has been empirically evaluated in three benchmark problems. During the experiments, OFPI has employed a neural network trained with the extreme learning machine algorithm to approximate the value functions. Results have demonstrated the stability of OFPI using a global function approximator and also performance improvements over two baseline algorithms (SARSA and Q-learning) combined with eligibility traces and a radial basis function network.

AB Compared with traditional computational intelligence techniques such as the support vector machine, extreme learning machine (ELM) provides better generalization performance at a much faster learning speed without tuning model parameters. Unfortunately, the training process of ELM is still sensitive to the outliers or noises in the training set. On the other hand, when it comes to imbalanced datasets, ELM produces suboptimal classification models. In this paper, a kernel possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering-based ELM algorithm for class imbalance learning (CIL) is developed to handle the class imbalance problem in the presence of outliers and noises. A set of experiments are conducted on several artificial and real-world imbalanced datasets for testing the generalization performance of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, we compare its performance with some typical CIL methods. The results indicate that the proposed method is a very effective method for CIL, especially in the presence of outliers and noises in datasets.

DE Handover Management; Machine Learning; QoE
AB This paper presents a machine learning based handover management scheme for LTE to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the user in the presence of obstacles. We show that, in this scenario, a state-of-the-art handover algorithm is unable to select the appropriate target cell for handover, since it always selects the target cell with the strongest signal without taking into account the perceived QoE of the user after the handover. In contrast, our scheme learns from past experience how the QoE of the user is affected when the handover was done to a certain eNB. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme substantially improves the number of completed downloads and the average download time compared to state-of- the-art. Furthermore, its performance is close to an optimal approach in the coverage region affected by an obstacle.

AB It is commonplace for the lack of labeled data in novel domains on medical image computer-aided diagnosis but there have been some labeled data or prior knowledge in old correlative domains. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is introduced into Medical Image processing. And then we present an Extreme Learning Machine based on Gastric Cancer Computer-Aided Diagnoses algorithm (GCCAD). The proposed GCCAD by means of ELM can do a better feature mapping, which achieves an acceptable performance within a few times. The experiment is performed datasets on Gastric Cancer of Lymph Node database which comes from some a hospital. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance compared with SVM both in classification accuracy and time that cost, and it improves diagnosis accuracy rate of medical images effectively the same as the algorithm need lest time for training a good classification model.

AB In this study, the use of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for automatic identification of the adhesion state is investigated. The influence of different activation functions and the number of neurons in the hidden layers on the recognition performance is investigated. This study aims to select a better activation function and construct an approach for the adhesion state recognition by using an ELM. Monitoring data on the adhesion characteristics of a heavy-duty locomotive are used to fabricate the recognition model. Comparing with the backpropagation (BP) neural network and a BP optimized algorithm, the experimental results show that our ELM recognition method has a faster training speed and higher recognition accuracy than the other two approaches.

AB Latent state space models are a fundamental and widely used tool for modeling dynamical systems. However, they are difficult to learn from data and learned models often lack performance guarantees on inference tasks such as filtering and prediction. In this work, we present the PREDICTIVE STATE INFERENCE MACHINE (PSIM), a data-driven method that considers the inference procedure on a dynamical system as a composition of predictors. The key idea is that rather than first learning a latent state space model, and then using the learned model for inference, PSIM directly learns predictors for inference in predictive state space. We provide theoretical guarantees for inference, in both realizable and agnostic settings, and showcase practical performance on a variety of simulated and real world robotics benchmarks.

AB The current work addresses quantum machine learning in the context of Quantum Artificial Neural Networks such that the networks' Processing is divided in two stages: the learning stage, where the network converges to a specific quantum circuit, and the backpropagation stage, where the network effectively works as a self-programing quantum computing system that selects the quantum circuits to solve computing problems.' The results are extended to general architectures including recurrent networks that interact with an environment, coupling with it in the neural links' activation order, and self-organizing in a dynamical regime that intermixes patterns of dynamical stochasticity and persistent quasiperiodic dynamics, making emerge a form of noise resilient dynamical record.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a remote sensor able to extract three-dimensional information. Environmental models in forest areas have been benefited by the use of LiDAR-derived information in the last years. A multiple linear regression (MLR) with previous stepwise feature selection is the most common method in the literature to develop those models. MLR defines the relation between the set of field measurements and the statistics extracted from a LiDAR flight. Machine learning has emerged as a suitable tool to improve classic stepwise MLR results on LiDAR. Unfortunately, few studies have been proposed to compare the quality of the multiple machine learning approaches. This paper presents a comparison between the classic MLR-based methodology and regression techniques in machine learning (neural networks, support vector machines, nearest neighbour, ensembles such as random forests) with special emphasis on regression trees. The selected techniques are applied to real LiDAR data from two areas in the province of Lugo (Galizia, Spain). The results confirm that classic MLR is outperformed by machine learning techniques and concretely, our experiments suggest that Support Vector Regression with Gaussian kernels statistically outperforms the rest of the techniques.

AB Promoters are DNA sequences containing regulatory elements required to guide and modulate the transcription initiation of the gene. Predicting promoter sequences in genomic sequences is a significant task in genome annotation and understanding transcriptional regulation. In the past decade many methods with many feature extraction schemes have been proposed for the prediction of eukaryotic and prokaryotic promoters. Still there is great need for more accurate and faster methods. In this paper we employed extreme learning machine algorithm (ELM), for promoter prediction in DNA sequences of H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, C. elegans and E. coli. We extracted dinucleotide and CpG island features, and achieved accuracy above 90% for all the five species. Performance is compared with the feed forward back propagation algorithm (BP) and support vector machines (SVM) and the results establish the viability of the presented approach.

AB Machine learning techniques were applied to job accounting and performance data for application classification. Job data were accumulated using the XDMoD monitoring technology named SUPReMM; they consist of job accounting information, application information from Lariat/XALT, and job performance data from TACC_Stats. The results clearly demonstrate that community applications have characteristic signatures which can be exploited for job classification. We conclude that machine learning can assist in classifying jobs of unknown application; in characterizing the job mixture; and in harnessing the variation in node and time dependence for further analysis.

AB Cloud computing is a rapidly emerging field, services and applications are more or less 24/7. Resource dimensioning in this field is a great issue. Research is already going on to imply reinforcement learning to automate decision making process in case of addition, reduction, migration and maintenance of the Virtual Machines (VM) to balance the service level performance and VM management cost. Models have been proposed in this case based on Q-learning, a very popular reinforcement learning technique that is used to find optimal action selection policy for any finite Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper we propose to work with the challenges like proper initialization of the early stages, designing the states, actions, transitions using Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solving the MDP with two popular reinforcement learning techniques, Q-learning and SARSAO(lambda).

Our method is based on Savitzky-Golay filter for preprocessing and a relatively recent evolution of single hidden-layer feed-forward network (SLFN) learning technique called extreme learning machine (ELM) for prediction. We tested our method with Africa Soil Property Prediction dataset, and observed that the results were promising.

DE parallel auto-tuning; machine learning
AB Machine Learning (ML) approaches are widely-used classification/regression methods for data mining applications. However, the time-consuming training process greatly limits the efficiency of ML approaches. We use the example of SVM (traditional ML algorithm) and DNN (state-of-the-art ML algorithm) to illustrate the idea in this paper. For SVM, a major performance bottleneck of current tools is that they use a unified data storage format because the data formats can have a significant influence on the complexity of storage and computation, memory bandwidth, and the efficiency of parallel processing. To address the problem above, we study the factors influencing the algorithm's performance and conduct auto-tuning to speed up SVM training. DNN training is even slower than SVM. For example, using a 8-core CPUs to train AlexNet model by CIFAR-10 dataset costs 8.2 hours. CIFAR-10 is only 170 MB, which is not efficient for distributed processing. Moreover, due to the algorithm limitation, only a small batch of data can be processed at each iteration. We focus on finding the right algorithmic parameters and using auto-tuning techniques to make the algorithm run faster. For SVM training, our implementation achieves 1.7-16.3x speedup (6.8x on average) against the non-adaptive case (using the worst data format) for various datasets. For DNN training on CIFAR-10 dataset, we reduce the time from 8.2 hours to only roughly 1 minute. We use the benchmark of dollars per speedup to help the users to select the right deep learning hardware.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB In order to utilize the distributed characteristic of sensors, distributed machine learning has become the mainstream approach, but the different computing capability of sensors and network delays greatly influence the accuracy and the convergence rate of the machine learning model. Our paper describes a reasonable parameter communication optimization strategy to balance the training overhead and the communication overhead. We extend the fault tolerance of iterative-convergent machine learning algorithms and propose the Dynamic Finite Fault Tolerance (DFFT). Based on the DFFT, we implement a parameter communication optimization strategy for distributed machine learning, named Dynamic Synchronous Parallel Strategy (DSP), which uses the performance monitoring model to dynamically adjust the parameter synchronization strategy between worker nodes and the Parameter Server (PS). This strategy makes full use of the computing power of each sensor, ensures the accuracy of the machine learning model, and avoids the situation that the model training is disturbed by any tasks unrelated to the sensors.

AB In scheduling problems, the learning phenomenon is often seen in some practical applications such as in the processing of certain chemicals in oil refineries and in the steel plates or bars produced by a foundry. A review of the literature reveals that most researchers paid more attention to the scheduling with both the single-machine settings and the learning without a bound. This is at odds with reality and thereby highlights the importance of addressing the issue by different approaches. This paper tackles the issue by considering a two-machine flowshop problem with a truncated learning consideration where the objective function is to minimize the makespan. In order to solve the proposed model, a branch-and-bound algorithm is first developed for the optimal solution. Then four genetic heuristic-based algorithms are proposed for the near-optimal solution. In addition, the experimental results of all proposed algorithms are also provided.

AB the traditional ELM algorithm in the hidden layer part parameters when the data sets are determined randomly and outliers are present, using the least squares method often exaggerate the singular value influence, cause the system deviation, resulting in the results of ELM network instability. In view of the above problems, an improved algorithm for extreme learning machine is proposed. By introducing the M estimation method, the specific idea is iterative weighted least squares estimation of regression coefficient, so as to optimize the residual sum of squares objective function to determine the weights of each sample to improve the robustness of traditional extreme learning machine. Finally, the data set is constructed to validate the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method can reduce the impact of outliers and improve the prediction accuracy.

AB Unmanned systems are increasing in number, while their manning requirements remain the same. To decrease manpower demands, machine learning techniques and autonomy are gaining traction and visibility. One barrier is human perception and understanding of autonomy. Machine learning techniques can result in " black box" algorithms that may yield high fitness, but poor comprehension by operators. However, Interactive Machine Learning (IML), a method to incorporate human input over the course of algorithm development by using neuro-evolutionary machine-learning techniques, may offer a solution. IML is evaluated here for its impact on developing autonomous team behaviors in an area search task. Initial findings show that IML-generated search plans were chosen over plans generated using a non-interactive ML technique, even though the participants trusted them slightly less. Further, participants discriminated each of the two types of plans from each other with a high degree of accuracy, suggesting the IML approach imparts behavioral characteristics into algorithms, making them more recognizable. Together the results lay the foundation for exploring how to team humans successfully with ML behavior.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a kind of imaging modality, which offers clearer images of soft tissues than computed tomography (CT). It is especially suitable for brain disease detection. It is beneficial to detect diseases automatically and accurately. We proposed a pathological brain detection method based on brain MR images and online sequential extreme learning machine. First, seven wavelet entropies (WE) were extracted from each brain MR image to form the feature vector. Then, an online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) was trained to differentiate pathological brains from the healthy controls. The experiment results over 132 brain MRIs showed that the proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of 93.51%, a specificity of 92.22%, and an overall accuracy of 93.33%, which suggested that our method is effective.

DE Machine Learning; Phishing Websites
AB Phishing is one among the luring strategies utilized by phishing artist in the aim of abusing the personal details of unsuspected clients. Phishing website is a counterfeit website with similar appearance, but changed destination. The unsuspected client post their information thinking that these websites originate from trusted financial institutions. New antiphishing techniques rise continuously, yet phishers come with new strategy by breaking all the antiphishing mechanisms. Hence there is a need for productive mechanism for the prediction of phishing website. This paper described comparison in classification of phishing websites using different Machine-learning algorithms. Random Forest (RF), C4.5, REP Tree, Decision Stump, Hoeffding Tree, Rotation Forest and MLP were used to determine which method provides the best results in phishing websites classification. All instances are categorized as 1 for "Legitimate", 0 for "Suspicious" and 1 for "Phishy". Results show that RF with REP Tree show the best performance on this dataset for classification of phishing websites.

AB Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network architecture that decouples the control plane and the data plane to provide unprecedented programmability, automation, and network control. The SDN controller exercises centralized control over network software, and in doing so, it can monitor and respond to malicious traffic for network protection. This paper proposes a threat-aware system based on machine-learning for timely detection and response against network intrusion in SDN. Our proposed system consists of data preprocessing for feature selection, predictive data modeling for machine-learning and anomaly detection, and decision making for intrusion response in SDN. Due to the time-critical nature of SDN, we propose a practical approach utilizing machine-learning techniques to protect against network intrusion and reduce uncertainty in decision-making outcomes. The maliciousness of most uncertain network traffic subsets is evaluated with selected significant feature sets. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves high performance and significantly reduces uncertainty in the decision process with a small number of feature sets. The results help the SDN controller to properly react against known or unknown attacks that cannot be prevented by signature-based network intrusion detection systems.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is extended from the generalized single hidden layer feedforward networks where the input weights of the hidden layer nodes can be assigned randomly. It has been widely used for its much faster learning speed and less manual works. Considering the field of multi-label text classification, in this paper, we propose an ELM based algorithm combined with L-21-norm minimization of the output weights matrix called L-21-norm Minimization ELM, which not only fully inherits the merits of ELM but also facilitates group sparsity and reduces complexity of the learning model. Extensive experiments on several benchmark data sets show that our proposed algorithm can obtain superior performances compared with other common multi-label classification algorithms.

AB The current information age is flooded with data, much of which is complicated and difficult to interpret. It has therefore become necessary to create computational tools that allow for the processing and analysis of large datasets. Main goal of this contribution is to examine the effectiveness of fiveteen different machine learning algorithms for classifying a business from the Forbes 2000 ranking of the world's largest companies, based on their market value statistics. Used algorithms cover also simple models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbour, Generalized Linear Models and computationally challenging models such as tree based algorithms, ensemble methods and neural networks. Contribution shows that k-nearest neighbour algorithm and ensemble methods give better results of classifying banking and non-banking companies based on market value statistics than traditional tree based methods or neural networks for this dataset in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

AB An unsolved problem in neuroevolution (NE) is to evolve artificial neural networks (ANN) that can store and use information to change their behavior online. While plastic neural networks have shown promise in this context, they have difficulties retaining information over longer periods of time and integrating new information without losing previously acquired skills. Here we build on recent work by Graves et al. [5] who extended the capabilities of an ANN by combining it with an external memory bank trained through gradient descent. In this paper, we introduce an evolvable version of their Neural Turing Machine (NTM) and show that such an approach greatly simplifies the neural model, generalizes better, and does not require accessing the entire memory content at each time-step. The Evolvable Neural Turing Machine (ENTM) is able to solve a simple copy tasks and for the first time, the continuous version of the double T-Maze, a complex reinforcement-like learning problem. In the T-Maze learning task the agent uses the memory bank to display adaptive behavior that normally requires a plastic ANN, thereby suggesting a complementary and effective mechanism for adaptive behavior in NE.

We propose a query by humming system for music retrieval that uses deep neural networks for note transcription and a note-based retrieval system for retrieving the correct song from the database. We evaluate our query by humming system using the standard MIREX QBSH dataset. We also propose a similar artist recommendation system which recommends similar artists based on acoustic features of the artists' music, online text descriptions of the artists and social media data. We use supervised machine learning techniques over all our features and compare our recommendation results to those produced by a popular similar artist recommendation website.

AB More than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is being generated across the globe. In fact, this data is as much as 90% of the data in the world today, and has been created in the last two years alone. Big data describes the large volume of data that inundates a business on a day to day basis. Huge amount of data is being generated by everything around us at all times and is produced by every digital process and social media exchange through systems, sensors, mobile devices, etc. Big data analytics examines large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other insights. To extract meaningful value from big data, one needs optimal processing power, analytics capabilities and skills. Using the concept of machine learning, a number of algorithms are explored in order to predict the result of class students. Based on the performance of the students in previous semester, and the scores of internal examinations of the current semester, the final result, whether the student passes or fails the current semester is computed before the final examination actually takes place.

ID PERFORMANCE PREDICTION
AB Today, most high-performance computing (HPC) platforms have heterogeneous hardware resources (CPUs, GPUs, storage, etc.) A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a parallel computing coprocessor specialized in accelerating vector operations. The prediction of application execution times over these devices is a great challenge and is essential for efficient job scheduling. There are different approaches to do this, such as analytical modeling and machine learning techniques. Analytic predictive models are useful, but require manual inclusion of interactions between architecture and software, and may not capture the complex interactions in GPU architectures. Machine learning techniques can learn to capture these interactions without manual intervention, but may require large training sets.
   In this paper, we compare three different machine learning approaches: linear regression, support vector machines and random forests with a BSP-based analytical model, to predict the execution time of GPU applications. As input to the machine learning algorithms, we use profiling information from 9 different applications executed over 9 different GPUs. We show that machine learning approaches provide reasonable predictions for different cases. Although the predictions were inferior to the analytical model, they required no detailed knowledge of application code, hardware characteristics or explicit modeling. Consequently, whenever a database with profile information is available or can be generated, machine learning techniques can be useful for deploying automated online performance prediction for scheduling applications on heterogeneous architectures containing GPUs.

AB This paper presents a machine-learning approach for regional photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting of up to 2 days ahead with hourly resolution. Physical PV power model is aggregated by geographical clusters and then summed for an entire ISO load zone. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts provide parameters, such as irradiance, temperature, barometric pressure, and wind speed, which are used as inputs to calculate plane of array (POA) irradiance and PV output power. A machine-learning approach is then developed. Bias correction for calculated power is conducted using linear regression method. During this procedure, categorization in accordance to critical parameters is employed to obtain a fine approximation. With optimized blending coefficients, adaptive mixture of correction results following different NWP methods is introduced to obtain an intelligent and adaptable output power PV forecast. A case study for the period from June 12, 2014 to January 24, 2015 of Southeastern Massachusetts (SEMA) load zone is carried out. Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) is 5.28% for day-ahead forecast horizon, which is reduced by 30.6% compared to the baseline that the best individual model is used.

DE Code smells detection; Machine learning; Code smell severity; Ordinal
   classification; Refactoring prioritization
AB Several code smells detection tools have been developed providing different results, because smells can be subjectively interpreted and hence detected in different ways. Machine learning techniques have been used for different topics in software engineering, e.g., design pattern detection, code smell detection, bug prediction, recommending systems. In this paper, we focus our attention on the classification of code smell severity through the use of machine learning techniques in different experiments. The severity of code smells is an important factor to take into consideration when reporting code smell detection results, since it allows the prioritization of refactoring efforts. In fact, code smells with high severity can be particularly large and complex, and create larger issues to the maintainability of software a system. In our experiments, we apply several machine learning models, spanning from multinomial classification to regression, plus a method to apply binary classifiers for ordinal classification. In fact, we model code smell severity as an ordinal variable. We take the baseline models from previous work, where we applied binary classification models for code smell detection with good results. We report and compare the performance of the models according to their accuracy and four different performance measures used for the evaluation of ordinal classification techniques. From our results, while the accuracy of the classification of severity is not high as in the binary classification of absence or presence of code smells, the ranking correlation of the actual and predicted severity for the best models reaches 0.88-0.96, measured through Spearman's p.

AB The relationships between the fatigue crack growth rate (da/dN) and stress intensity factor range (Delta K) are not always linear even in the Paris region. The stress ratio effects on fatigue crack growth rate are diverse in different materials. However, most existing fatigue crack growth models cannot handle these nonlinearities appropriately. The machine learning method provides a flexible approach to the modeling of fatigue crack growth because of its excellent nonlinear approximation and multivariable learning ability. In this paper, a fatigue crack growth calculation method is proposed based on three different machine learning algorithms (MLAs): extreme learning machine (ELM), radial basis function network (RBFN) and genetic algorithms optimized back propagation network (GABP). The MLA based method is validated using testing data of different materials. The three MLAs are compared with each other as well as the classical two-parameter model (K* approach). The results show that the predictions of MLAs are superior to those of K* approach in accuracy and effectiveness, and the ELM based algorithms show overall the best agreement with the experimental data out of the three MLAs, for its global optimization and extrapolation ability.

AB Network security is the provision made in an underlying computer network or rules made by the administrator to protect the network and its resources from unauthorized access. Network Security is becoming a crucial issue for all the firms and companies and with the increase in knowledge of intruders and hackers they have made many prosperous attempts to bring down web services and high-profile company networks. Misuse detection detects intrusions by matching the network traffic with a database of stored signatures and anomaly detection looks for behavior deviating from normal or common behavior for detecting intrusions. The primary objective of this paper is to combine both these techniques. The KDD dataset is used for this purpose. Finally, the data is processed by classification algorithms to obtain the results. The results show a high percentage of correct classification and accuracy. Experimental evaluation shows that the combined approach of Machine learning and misuse detection gives better performance.

AB With the development of machine learning techniques, artificial intelligence applications in medicine are becoming hot topic in health information systems. In this research, we construct a new basic heart failure disease database which contains 1715 patients and 400 features. Then, we propose a new machine learning method called Polynomial Smooth Support Vector Machine(PSSVM) to help doctors diagnose heart disease, after solved by BFGS method, the algorithm parameters are obtained and they can be used to determine the state of patients' heart disease. In order to solve the problem of high dimension of database and enhance the speed of PSSVM, we use PCA, LDA, CCA and LPP methods to decrease the features. Finally, we compare the performance of our method with LibSVM and ELM. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with LibSVM and ELM.

AB This paper compares machine learning techniques for detecting malicious webpages. The conventional method of detecting malicious webpages is going through the black list and checking whether the webpages are listed. Black list is a list of webpages which are classified as malicious from a user's point of view. These black lists are created by trusted organizations and volunteers. They are then used by modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. However, black list is ineffective because of the frequent-changing nature of webpages, growing numbers of webpages that pose scalability issues and the crawlers' inability to visit intranet webpages that require computer operators to log in as authenticated users. In this paper therefore alternative and novel approaches are used by applying machine learning algorithms to detect malicious webpages. In this paper three supervised machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Classifier, and two unsupervised machine learning techniques such as K-Means and Affinity Propagation are employed. Please note that K-Means and Affinity Propagation have not been applied to detection of malicious webpages by other researchers. All these machine learning techniques have been used to build predictive models to analyze large number of malicious and safe webpages. These webpages were downloaded by a concurrent crawler taking advantage of gevent. The webpages were parsed and various features such as content, URL and screenshot of webpages were extracted to feed into the machine learning models. Computer simulation results have produced an accuracy of up to 98% for the supervised techniques and silhouette coefficient of close to 0.96 for the unsupervised techniques. These predictive models have been applied in a practical context whereby Google Chrome can harness the predictive capabilities of the classifiers that have the advantages of both the lightweight and the heavyweight classifiers.

AB Grey model GM(1,1) which implies first-order derivative and one independent variable is considered to predict results producing better accuracy. Solving the grey model GM(n,m) for prediction is still being a challenge due to erroneous results of higher order derivatives, where n is the derivative order and m, number of independent variables. In this paper, we solve this challenge through reduction method and recursive computation. Thereupon, we propose a new method called GM(n,m,k) which is generalized using Machine Learning, where k is a set of constraints belonging to m dependent or independent variables of a given system. We have applied and tested the proposed grey model to applications in airlines industry and it is proved to give results with much better accuracy than the traditional grey model.

AB Infrared thermography has been widely used today for nondestructive evaluation and testing of materials and other qualitative approaches. However, the field of thermography is much less developed. Most of the existing research uses a relatively simple model, while more realistic models are currently in development. One interesting scenario for thermography is determining the material composition of objects based on their thermal response to excitation, which could lead to applications such as multimodal human-computer interaction, teleoperation and non-contact haptic mapping. This paper presents a system that is capable of classification between a range of different materials in real time, using laser excitation step thermography and a set of machine learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate a consistently high accuracy in determining the label of the material, even when the dataset is composed of multiple different sessions of data acquisition.

AB Earthquake magnitude prediction for Hindukush region has been carried out in this research using the temporal sequence of historic seismic activities in combination with the machine learning classifiers. Prediction has been made on the basis of mathematically calculated eight seismic indicators using the earthquake catalog of the region. These parameters are based on the well-known geophysical facts of Gutenberg-Richter's inverse law, distribution of characteristic earthquake magnitudes and seismic quiescence. In this research, four machine learning techniques including pattern recognition neural network, recurrent neural network, random forest and linear programming boost ensemble classifier are separately applied to model relationships between calculated seismic parameters and future earthquake occurrences. The problem is formulated as a binary classification task and predictions are made for earthquakes of magnitude greater than or equal to 5.5 ( 5.5), for the duration of 1 month. Furthermore, the analysis of earthquake prediction results is carried out for every machine learning classifier in terms of sensitivity, specificity, true and false predictive values. Accuracy is another performance measure considered for analyzing the results. Earthquake magnitude prediction for the Hindukush using these aforementioned techniques show significant and encouraging results, thus constituting a step forward toward the final robust prediction mechanism which is not available so far.

AB Machine learning is a useful method to assess biomedical data. However, due to the complexity of these data, it is important to rely on a robust methodology. Predictions with machine learning are not only an add-on to statistical analysis but are a real process of discovering and establishing clinical validity of the diagnostic techniques. This paper describes a machine learning approach to predict balance changes in seniors based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Functional MRI results in a huge amount data containing some noise. Thus, a noise filtering technique is proposed and subsequent analyses are conducted with various machine learning algorithms. The best prediction of the balance ability based on brain activation patterns was obtained by applying a neural network approach. This resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Other learning algorithms such as the tree ensemble are less predictive but allow tracking and better understanding of the source of differentiation. The results are based on a real dataset.

AB This paper presents a machine learning approach to predict the amount of compute memory needed by jobs which are submitted to Load Sharing Facility (LSF (R)) with a high level of accuracy. LSF (R) is the compute resource manager and job scheduler for Qualcomm chip design process. It schedules the jobs based on available resources: CPU, memory, storage, and software licenses. Memory is one of the key resources and its proper utilization leads to a substantial improvement in saving machine resources which in turn results in a significant reduction in overall job pending time. In addition, efficient memory utilization helps to reduce the operations cost by decreasing the number of servers needed for the end-to-end design process.
   In this paper, we explored a suite of statistical and machine learning techniques to develop a Compute Memory Recommender System for the Qualcomm chip design process with over 90% accuracy in predicting the amount of memory a job needs. Moreover, it demonstrates the potential to significantly reduce job pending time.

AB Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data. Quantum systems produce atypical patterns that classical systems are thought not to produce efficiently, so it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement quantum software that could enable machine learning that is faster than that of classical computers. Recent work has produced quantum algorithms that could act as the building blocks of machine learning programs, but the hardware and software challenges are still considerable.

DE Extreme learning machine; ELM-based autoencoder; Pre-trained parameter;
   Classification
AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a promising learning method for training "generalized" single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), which has attracted significant interest recently for its fast learning speed, good generalization ability and ease of implementation. However, due to its manually selected network parameters (e.g., the input weights and hidden biases), the performance of ELM may be easily deteriorated. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-trained extreme learning machine (P-ELM for short) for classification problems. In P-ELM, the superior network parameters are pre-trained by an ELM-based autoencoder (ELM-AE) and embedded with the underlying data information, which can improve the performance of the proposed method. Experiments and comparisons on face image recognition and handwritten image annotation applications demonstrate that P-ELM is promising and achieves superior results compared to the original ELM algorithm and other ELM-based algorithms.

AB Utilizing new technologies is the key to improve user experience in museums. Natural and unobtrusive methods like those offered by machine learning approaches are more desired by users. So far, the research on machine learning applications in museums is mostly limited to art authentication, guiding and virtual reality. Yet, machine learning has powerful methods to extract information from any type of data and therefore there are other interesting applications which can have a significant effect on museum experience. The current work is an attempt to find an abstract and yet elaborate view into the existing machine learning applications in museums in general and automatic guide methods in particular. To do so, applications are grouped into different categories and for each category the usefulness of applying machine learning along with the existing methods, if any, are presented. Furthermore, a precise explanation on new directions accompanied by examples is provided. We expect this paper to be of interest to the machine learning researchers since it provides a guideline to proper directions of research in this realm.

ID BAD SMELLS; QUALITY; CLASSIFICATION
AB Several code smell detection tools have been developed providing different results, because smells can be subjectively interpreted, and hence detected, in different ways. In this paper, we perform the largest experiment of applying machine learning algorithms to code smells to the best of our knowledge. We experiment 16 different machine-learning algorithms on four code smells (Data Class, Large Class, Feature Envy, Long Method) and 74 software systems, with 1986 manually validated code smell samples. We found that all algorithms achieved high performances in the cross-validation data set, yet the highest performances were obtained by J48 and Random Forest, while the worst performance were achieved by support vector machines. However, the lower prevalence of code smells, i.e., imbalanced data, in the entire data set caused varying performances that need to be addressed in the future studies. We conclude that the application of machine learning to the detection of these code smells can provide high accuracy (>96 %), and only a hundred training examples are needed to reach at least 95 % accuracy.

AB Software development has become an essential activity for organizations that increasingly rely on these to manage their business. However, poor software quality reduces customer satisfaction, while high-quality software can reduce repairs and rework by more than 50 percent. Software development is now seen as a collaborative and technology-dependent activity performed by a group of people. For all these reasons, choosing correctly software development members teams can be decisive. Considering this motivation, classifying participants in different profiles can be useful during project management team's formation and tasks distribution. This paper presents a developer modeling approach based on software quality metrics. Quality metrics are dynamically collected. Those metrics compose the developer model. A machine learning-based method is presented. Results show that it is possible to use quality metrics to model developers.

AB Recognition of complex dynamic texture is a difficult task and captures the attention of the computer vision community for several decades. Essentially the dynamic texture recognition is a multi-class classification problem that has become a real challenge for computer vision and machine learning techniques. Due to the reason that the dynamic textures lie in non-Euclidean manifold, existing classifier such as extreme learning machine cannot effectively deal with this problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle the dynamic texture recognition problem. First, we utilize the affinity propagation clustering technology to design a codebook, and then construct a soft coding feature to represent the whole dynamic texture sequence. This new coding strategy preserves spatial and temporal characteristics of dynamic texture. Finally, by evaluating the proposed approach on the DynTex dataset, we show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared with the model based on the artificial neural network, the proposed ELM model can obtain the accurate results for microwave passive component design with the small training datasets due to its good iterative learning ability. The validity and efficiency of this proposed model is confirmed by a triple-mode filter.

AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new method for using single hidden layer feed-forward networks with a much simpler training method. While conventional kernel-based classifiers are based on a single kernel, in reality, it is often desirable to base classifiers on combinations of multiple kernels. In this paper, we propose the issue of multiple-kernel learning (MKL) for ELM by formulating it as a semi-infinite linear programming. We further extend this idea by integrating with techniques of MKL. The kernel function in this ELM formulation no longer needs to be fixed, but can be automatically learned as a combination of multiple kernels. Two formulations of multiple-kernel classifiers are proposed. The first one is based on a convex combination of the given base kernels, while the second one uses a convex combination of the so-called equivalent kernels. Empirically, the second formulation is particularly competitive. Experiments on a large number of both toy and real-world data sets (including high-magnification sampling rate image data set) show that the resultant classifier is fast and accurate and can also be easily trained by simply changing linear program.

DE Deep learning; Restricted Boltzmann Machine; Big data; MapReduce
AB Deep learning is recently regarded as the closest artificial intelligence model to human brain. It is about learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. One deep model often consists of a hierarchical architecture that has the capability to model super non-linear and stochastic problems. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is the main constructing block of current deep networks, as most of deep architectures are built with it. Based on MapReduce framework and Hadoop distributed file system, this paper proposes a distributed algorithm for training the RBM model. Its implementation and performance are evaluated on Big Data platform-Hadoop. The main contribution of the new learning algorithm is that it solves the scalability problem that limits the development of deep learning. The intelligence growing process of human brain requires learning from Big Data. The distributed learning mechanism for RBM makes it possible to abstract sophisticated and informative features from Big Data to achieve high-level intelligence. The evaluations of the proposed learning algorithm are carried out on image inpainting and classification problems based on the BAS dataset and MNIST hand-written digits dataset.

AB Machine learning has immense potential to enhance diagnostic and intervention research in the behavioral sciences, and may be especially useful in investigations involving the highly prevalent and heterogeneous syndrome of autism spectrum disorder. However, use of machine learning in the absence of clinical domain expertise can be tenuous and lead to misinformed conclusions. To illustrate this concern, the current paper critically evaluates and attempts to reproduce results from two studies (Wall et al. in Transl Psychiatry 2(4):e100, 2012a; PloS One 7(8), 2012b) that claim to drastically reduce time to diagnose autism using machine learning. Our failure to generate comparable findings to those reported by Wall and colleagues using larger and more balanced data underscores several conceptual and methodological problems associated with these studies. We conclude with proposed best-practices when using machine learning in autism research, and highlight some especially promising areas for collaborative work at the intersection of computational and behavioral science.

AB Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence basically involves tasks of modifying and supervising problems taken as vectors in multi-dimensional space. The Primitive algorithms which are used take Polynomial Time for computing such vector problems which are not fruitful for us, on the other hand, Quantum algorithms have the capability to solve such vector problems in a considerable amount of time by using Quantum-Mechanical operations. For example, we can perform a Database Search in a time which is Quadratic-ally faster than the primitive search algorithm. Quantum Algorithms rely on Quantum physics and therefore the algorithms are Incoherent in nature and this property makes them more interesting to study. In this paper, we provide the insights of Quantum Machine Learning and we formally prove that the Execution Time of the algorithm is greatly optimized with the help of Adiabatic Quantum Learning. Also, we prove that Quantum Associative Memories can store exponentially more data than its primitive counterparts. Data mining concept is very similar to Machine Learning and we will also show how QML will be beneficial in such cause as well.

For the 4th Revolution in Education, an active and interactive presence of students contributes to a higher learning quality. Machine Learning techniques recently have shown impressive development steps of the use of data analysis and predictions. However, it has been far less used for assessing the learning quality. For this paper we conducted analysis based on neural networks, support vector machine, decision trees and cluster analysis to estimate student's performance at examination and shape the next generation's talent for Industry 4.0 skills.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB Managing large systems in order to guarantee certain behavior is a difficult problem due to their dynamic behavior and complex interactions. Policies have been shown to provide a very expressive and easy way to define such desired behaviors, mainly because they separate the definition of desired behavior from the enforcement mechanism, allowing either one to be changed fairly easily. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to define policies in terms of attributes that can be measured and/or directly controlled, or to set adaptable (i.e. non-static) parameters in order to account for rapidly changing system behavior. Dynamic policies are meant to solve these problems by allowing system administrators to define higher level parameters, which are more closely related to the business goals, while providing an automated mechanism to adapt them at a lower level, where attributes can be measured and/or controlled. Here, we present a way to define such policies, and a machine learning model that is able to dynamically apply lower level static policies by learning a hidden relationship between the high level business attribute space, and the low level monitoring space. We show that this relationship exists, and that we can learn it producing an error of at most 8.78% at least 96% of the time.

AB This paper approaches, from a computational perspective, the problem of predicting the stature of human skeletal remains from bone measurements. There are traditional methods for constructing models that give good results for stature estimation. In this paper, we aim to investigate the usefulness of using machine learning-based models to approximate stature. Assuming that the stature of an individual is indirectly related to bone measurement values, we can derive methods that learn from archaeological data and construct models that give good estimates of the stature. Two novel machine learning-based regression models for stature estimation are proposed in this paper. Experiments using artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms were performed on samples from the Terry Collection Postcranial Osteometric Database, and the obtained results are discussed and compared with the results from other similar studies. The experimental evaluations indicate that the machine learning-based regression models are efficient for the stature estimation of archaeological remains and highlight the potential of our proposal.

AB This paper proposes and evaluates MALMOS, a novel framework for mobile offloading scheduling based on online machine learning techniques. In contrast to previous works, which rely on application-dependent parameters or pre-defined static scheduling policies, MALMOS provides an online training mechanism for the machine learning-based runtime scheduler such that it supports a flexible policy that dynamically adapts scheduling decisions based on the observation of previous offloading decisions and their correctness. To demonstrate its practical applicability, we integrated MALMOS with an existing Java-based, offloading-capable code refactoring framework, DPartner. Using this integration, we performed quantitative experiments to evaluate the performance and cost for three machine learning algorithms: instance-based learning, perceptron, and naive Bayes, with respect to classifier training time, classification time, and scheduling accuracy. Particularly, we examined the adaptability of MALMOS to various network conditions and computing capabilities of remote resources by comparing the scheduling accuracy with two static scheduling cases: threshold-based and linear equation-based scheduling policies. Our evaluation uses an Android-based prototype for experiments, and considers benchmarks with different computation/ communication characteristics, and different computing capabilities of remote resources. The evaluation shows that MALMOS achieves 10.9%similar to 40.5% higher scheduling accuracy than two static scheduling policies.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for detection of liver abnormalities in an automated manner using ultrasound images. For this purpose, we have implemented a machine learning model that can, not only generate labels (normal and abnormal) for a given ultrasound image but, it can also detect when its prediction is likely to be incorrect. The proposed model abstains from generating the label of a test example if it is not confident about its prediction. Such behavior is commonly practiced by medical doctors who, when given insufficient information or a difficult case, can choose to carry out further clinical or diagnostic tests before generating a diagnosis. However, existing machine learning models are designed in a way to always generate a label for a given example even when the confidence of their prediction is low. We have proposed a novel stochastic gradient descent based solver for the learning with abstention paradigm and use it to make a practical, state of the art method for liver disease classification. The proposed method has been benchmarked on a data set of approximately 100 patients from MINAR, Multan, Pakistan and our results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is at par with medical experts.

Most of current proposals calculate a risk value according to the permissions required by the app through probabilistic functions that often provide unreliable risk values. To overcome such limitations, this paper presents RisklnDroid, a tool for risk analysis of Android apps based on machine learning techniques. Extensive empirical assessments carried out on more than 112 K apps and 6 K malware samples indicate that RisklnDroid outperforms probabilistic methods in terms of precision and reliability.

AB Patient telemonitoring results in an aggregation of significant amounts of information about patient disease trajectory. However, the potential use of this information for early prediction of exacerbations in adult asthma patients has not been systematically evaluated. The aim of this study was to explore the utility of telemonitoring data for building machine learning algorithms that predict asthma exacerbations before they occur. The study dataset comprised daily self-monitoring reports consisting of 7001 records submitted by adult asthma patients during home telemonitoring. Predictive modeling included preparation of stratified training datasets, predictive feature selection, and evaluation of resulting classifiers. Using a 7-day window, a naive Bayesian classifier, adaptive Bayesian network, and support vector machines were able to predict asthma exacerbation occurring on day 8, with sensitivity of 0.80, 1.00, and 0.84; specificity of 0.77, 1.00, and 0.80; and accuracy of 0.77, 1.00, and 0.80, respectively. Our study demonstrated that machine learning techniques have significant potential in developing personalized decision support for chronic disease telemonitoring systems. Future studies may benefit from a comprehensive predictive framework that combines telemonitoring data with other factors affecting the likelihood of developing acute exacerbation. Approaches implemented for advanced asthma exacerbation prediction may be extended to prediction of exacerbations in patients with other chronic health conditions.

AB In recent years, the investors pay major attention to invest in gold market because of huge profits in the future. Gold is the only commodity which maintains its value even in the economic and financial crisis. Also, the gold prices are closely related with other commodities. The future gold price prediction becomes the warning system for the investors due to unforeseen risk in the market. Hence, an accurate gold price forecasting is required to foresee the business trends. This paper concentrates on forecasting the future gold prices from four commodities like historical data's of gold prices, silver prices, Crude oil prices, Standard and Poor's 500 stock index (S&P500) index and foreign exchange rate. The period used for the study is from 1st January 2000 to 31st April 2014. In this paper, a learning algorithm for single hidden layered Feed forward neural networks called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used which has good learning ability. Also, this study compares the five models namely Feed forward networks without feedback, Feed forward back propagation networks, Radial basis function, ELMAN networks and ELM learning model. The results prove that the ELM learning performs better than the other methods.

AB Dynamic scheduling of tasks in large-scale HPC platforms is normally accomplished using ad-hoc heuristics, based on task characteristics, combined with some backfilling strategy. Defining heuristics that work efficiently in different scenarios is a difficult task, specially when considering the large variety of task types and platform architectures. In this work, we present a methodology based on simulation and machine learning to obtain dynamic scheduling policies. Using simulations and a workload generation model, we can determine the characteristics of tasks that lead to a reduction in the mean slowdown of tasks in an execution queue. Modeling these characteristics using a nonlinear function and applying this function to select the next task to execute in a queue improved the mean task slowdown in synthetic workloads. When applied to real workload traces from highly different machines, these functions still resulted in performance improvements, attesting the generalization capability of the obtained heuristics.

AB Open pit mining operations require utilization of extremely expensive equipment such as large trucks, shovels and loaders. To remain competitive, mining companies are under pressure to increase equipment utilization and reduce operational costs. The key to this in mining operations is to have sophisticated truck assignment strategies which will ensure that equipment is utilized efficiently with minimum operating cost. To address this problem, we have implemented truck assignment approach which integrates machine learning, linear/integer programming and simulation. Our truck assignment approach takes into consideration the number of trucks and their sizes, shovels and dump locations as well as stochastic activity times during the operations. Machine learning is used to predict probability distributions of equipment activity duration. We have validated the approach using data collected from two open pit mines. Our experimental results show that our approach offers increase of 10% in efficiency. Presented results demonstrate that machine learning can bring significant value to mining industry.

AB We explored the use of machine learning methods for classifying whether a particular ABO(3) chemistry forms a perovskite or non-perovskite structured solid. Starting with three sets of feature pairs (the tolerance and octahedral factors, the A and B ionic radii relative to the radius of O, and the bond valence distances between the A and B ions from the O atoms), we used machine learning to create a hyper-dimensional partial dependency structure plot using all three feature pairs or any two of them. Doing so increased the accuracy of our predictions by 2-3 percentage points over using any one pair. We also included the Mendeleev numbers of the A and B atoms to this set of feature pairs. Doing this and using the capabilities of our machine learning algorithm, the gradient tree boosting classifier, enabled us to generate a new type of structure plot that has the simplicity of one based on using just the Mendeleev numbers, but with the added advantages of having a higher accuracy and providing a measure of likelihood of the predicted structure.

DE cognitive radio; spectrum sensing; machine learning; multi-antenna
AB In this paper, we propose a machine learning based spectrum sensing method using the sample covariance matrix of the received signal vector from multiple antennas. Before sensing, the cognitive radio (CR) will first apply the unsupervised learning algorithm (e.g., K-means Clustering) to discover primary user's (PU) transmission patterns. Then, the supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Support Vector Machine) is used to train CR to distinguish PU's status. These two learning phases are implemented using the feature vector that is formed by two parameters of the sample covariance matrix. One parameter is the ratio between the maximum eigenvalue and the minimum eigenvalue; the other is the ratio between the absolute sum of all matrix elements and absolute sum of the diagonal elements. The proposed method does not need any information about the signal, channel, and the noise power a priori. Simulations clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper presents a new approach to the production of feature maps for the improvement of classification in machine learning. The idea is based on a calculus of differentiation and integration of feature vectors, which can be viewed as functions on a metric space or network. Based on this we propose a novel network-based binary machine learning classifier. We illustrate our method using molecular networks alone to distinguish phenotypes, including cancer types and subtypes. We include feature sets derived from disease-specific gene co-expression networks in different cancer data sets using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) along with other previously published studies. We also illustrate our network-based predictor on another data type, based on infrared spectroscopy of lung cancer tissue.

AB In this work, data fusion of multi-element XRF results from archaeological feature soils and regional background soils was applied to assess the complementary value of geochemistry and machine-learning on predictive modelling in archaeology.
   Our principal aim was to integrate multiple data sources, train learning models for classification of archaeological soils and background soils, and compare model predictions for three validation areas with current archaeological interpretation and established predictive models. This was done using three supervised machine-learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and artificial neural networks) which were trained, cross-validated and tested. The validation areas included a high archaeological potential area (n = 247 samples), the Dutch province of Zeeland (n = 261 samples) and an excavated imprint of an ancient farmhouse (n = 38 samples). The predictive models showed good overall performance and correctly classified about 95% of all test instances. According to the learning models, the first validation site has a top soil horizon that shows limited parallels with archaeological horizons used in model training, whereas features of high archaeological probability become more apparent below this horizon. This is in good correspondence with geochemical depth profiles and current archaeological interpretation. As for the second validation site, the models highlighted several archaeological hotspots that to some extend spatially coincide with areas of high archaeological potential as indicated by established predictive modelling. Reversely, the classifiers attributed high archaeological potential status to the most southern region of Zeeland, thereby complementing established modelling results. For the third validation site none of the instances were correctly classified and these results clearly show the limitations of geochemical predictive modelling of significantly different soil types (fine-to-coarse sands) compared to the training set (clayey sands).
   Present proof-of-concept study shows that modelling of multiple-source geochemical soil data using machine-learning algorithms can be successfully accomplished and that model predictions nicely complement current interpretation and/or established archeological predictive modelling of areas of archaeological interest. Limitations of our approach were found to reside in lithological differences between sites used for model training and prediction sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper presents an improved extreme learning machine for online sequential prediction of multivariate time series. The multivariate time series is first phase-space reconstructed to form the input and output samples. Extreme learning machine, which has simple structure and good performance, is used as prediction model. On the basis of the specific network function of extreme learning machine, an improved Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, in which Hessian matrix and gradient vector are calculated iteratively, is developed to implement online sequential prediction. Finally, simulation results of artificial and real-world multivariate time series are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which was initially proposed for training single-layer feed-forward networks (SLFNs), provides us a unified efficient and effective framework for regression and multiclass classification. Though various ELM variants were proposed in recent years, most of them focused on the supervised learning scenario while little effort was made to extend it into unsupervised learning paradigm. Therefore, it is of great significance to put ELM into learning tasks with only unlabeled data. One popular approach for mining knowledge from unlabeled data is based on the manifold assumption, which exploits the geometrical structure of data by assuming that nearby points will also be close to each other in transformation space. However, considering the manifold information only is insufficient for discriminative tasks. In this paper, we propose an improved unsupervised discriminative ELM (UDELM) model, whose main advantage is to combine the local manifold learning with global discriminative learning together. UDELM can be efficiently optimized by solving a generalized eigenvalue decomposition problem. Extensive comparisons over several state-of-the-art models on clustering image and emotional EEG data demonstrate the efficacy of UDELM. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE live migration; performance modeling; machine learning; virtualization
AB Live migration is one of the key technologies to improve data center utilization, power efficiency, and maintenance. Various live migration algorithms have been proposed; each exhibiting distinct characteristics in terms of completion time, amount of data transferred, virtual machine (VM) downtime, and VM performance degradation. To make matters worse, not only the migration algorithm but also the applications running inside the migrated VM affect the different performance metrics. With service-level agreements and operational constraints in place, choosing the optimal live migration technique has so far been an open question. In this work, we propose an adaptive machine learning-based model that is able to predict with high accuracy the key characteristics of live migration in dependence of the migration algorithm and the workload running inside the VM. We discuss the important input parameters for accurately modeling the target metrics, and describe how to profile them with little overhead. Compared to existing work, we are not only able to model all commonly used migration algorithms but also predict important metrics that have not been considered so far such as the performance degradation of the VM. In a comparison with the state-of-the-art, we show that the proposed model outperforms existing work by a factor 2 to 5.

AB Machine-learning methods are evaluated to study the intriguing and debated topic of discrimination among different tectonic environments using geochemical and isotopic data. Volcanic rocks characterized by a whole geochemical signature of major elements (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3T, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O), selected trace elements (Sr, Ba, Rb, Zr, Nb, La, Ce, Nd, Hf, Sm, Gd, Y, Yb, Lu, Ta, Th) and isotopes (Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, Pb-208/Pb-204, Sr-87/Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144) have been extracted from open-access and comprehensive petrological databases (i.e., PetDB and GEOROC). The obtained dataset has been analyzed using support vector machines, a set of supervised machine-learning methods, which are considered particularly powerful in classification problems. Results from the application of the machine-learning methods show that the combined use of major, trace elements and isotopes allows associating the geochemical composition of rocks to the relative tectonic setting with high classification scores (93 %, on average). The lowest scores are recorded from volcanic rocks deriving from back-arc basins (65 %). All the other tectonic settings display higher classification scores, with oceanic islands reaching values up to 99 %. Results of this study could have a significant impact in other petrological studies potentially opening new perspectives for petrologists and geochemists. Other examples of applications include the development of more robust geothermometers and geobarometers and the recognition of volcanic sources for tephra layers in tephro-chronological studies.

AB The involvement of linguistic professionals in resolving the ambiguity of a word within a particular context will produce a concise meaning of the words that are found in the lexical knowledge based collection. Motivated from that issue, we employed lexical knowledge and machine learning approach which includes the integration of data or/and information from the lexical knowledge based, that is Malay collections which linked to the ambiguous words. We used the most open class word and removed the stop words from the targeted sentences. Experiments have been conducted with and without lexical knowledge on 50 ambiguous words. The Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) method is determined by machine learning, corpus based approaches namely Malay-Malay corpus and English-Malay corpus. The results show that the proposed method has improved the precision in resolving ambiguity.

AB As demonstrated earlier, the learning effectiveness and learning speed of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks are in general far slower than required, which has been a major bottleneck for many applications. Huang et al. proposed extreme learning machine (ELM) which improves the training speed by hundreds of times as compared to its predecessor learning techniques. This paper offers an ELM-based learning method that can grow subnetwork hidden nodes by pulling back residual network error to the hidden layer. Furthermore, the proposed method provides a similar or better generalization performance with remarkably fewer hidden nodes as compared to other ELM methods employing huge number of hidden nodes. Thus, the learning speed of the proposed technique is hundred times faster compared to other ELMs as well as to back propagation and support vector machines. The experimental validations for all methods are carried out on 32 data sets.

AB Audio classification has very large theoretical and practical values in both pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel audio classification method based on machine learning technique. Firstly, we illustrate the hierarchical structure of audio data, which is made up of four layers: 1) Audio frame, 2) Audio clip, 3) Audio shot, and 4) Audio high level semantic unit. Secondly, three types of audio data feature are extracted to construct feature vector, including 1) Short time energy, 2) Zero crossing rate and 3) Mel-Frequency cepstral coefficients. Thirdly, we discuss how to classify audio data using the SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve higher audio classification accuracy.

AB The Machine Learning is one of the areas of Artificial Intelligence whose objective is the development of computational techniques for knowledge and building systems able to acquire knowledge automatically. One of the main challenges of learning algorithms is to maximize generalization. Thus the board machine, or a combination of more of a learning machine approach known in literature with the denomination ensemble along with the theory agents, become a promising alternative in this challenge. In this context, this research proposes the iEnsemble framework, which aims to provide a model of the ensemble through a multi-agent system architecture, where generalization, combination and learning are made through agents, through the performance of their respective roles. In the proposal, the agents follow each their life cycle and also perform the iStacking algorithm. This algorithm is based on Stacking method, which uses the reinforcement learning to define the result of the Ensemble. To validate the initial proposal of the framework, some experiments have been performed and the results obtained and limitations are presented.

AB The learning speed of the feed forward neural network takes a lot of time to be trained which is a major drawback in their applications since the past decades. The key reasons behind may be due to the slow gradient-based learning algorithms which are extensively used to train the neural networks or due to the parameters in the networks which are tuned iteratively using some learning algorithms. Thus, in order to eradicate the above pitfalls, a new learning algorithm was proposed known as Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). This algorithm tries to compute Hidden-layer-output matrix that is made of randomly assigned input layer and hidden layer weights and randomly assigned biases. Unlike the other feedforward networks, ELM has the access of the whole training dataset before going into the computation part. Here, we have devised a new two-layer-feedforward network (TFFN) for ELM in a new manner with randomly assigning the weights and biases in both the hidden layers, which then calculates the output-hidden layer weights using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. TFFN doesn't restricts the algorithm to fix the number of hidden neurons that the algorithm should have. Rather it searches the space which gives an optimized result in the neurons combination in both the hidden layers. This algorithm provides a good generalization capability than the parent Extreme Learning Machines at an extremely fast learning speed. Here, we have experimented the algorithm on various types of datasets and various popular algorithm to find the performances and report a comparison.

AB Lately, costly and threatening DNS tunnels on the mobile networks bypassing the mobile operator's Policy and Charging Enforcement Function (PCEF), has shown the vulnerability of the mobile networks caused by the Domain Name System (DNS) which calls for protection solutions. Unfortunately there is currently no really adequate solution. This paper proposes to use machine learning techniques in the detection and mitigation of a DNS tunneling in mobile networks. Two machine learning techniques, namely One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and K-Means are experimented and the results prove that machine learning techniques could yield quite efficient detection solutions. The paper starts with a comprehensive introduction to DNS tunneling in mobile networks. Next the challenges in DNS tunneling detections are reviewed. The main part of the paper is the description of proposed DNS tunneling detection using machine learning.

AB Several antiretroviral drugs have been approved for use in HIV infected people. Despite efforts made by the scientific community, an effective drug that kills the virus has not been developed yet. A lot of computational algorithms have been used for finding mutations associated with drug resistance as well as for prediction of HIV resistance. This article provides an overview of machine learning techniques used to predict the HIV drug resistance. The different types of studies done will be reviewed through the following characteristics: different representations of the problem, ARVs, methods to reduce dimensionality and algorithms of machine learning used.

AB Modern machine learning techniques have been applied to many aspects of network analytics in order to discover patterns that can clarify or better demonstrate the behavior of users and systems within a given network. Often the information to be processed has to be converted to a different type in order for machine learning algorithms to be able to process them. To accurately process the information generated by systems within a network, the true intention and meaning behind the information must be observed. In this paper we propose different approaches for mapping network information such as IP addresses to integer values that attempts to keep the relation present in the original format of the information intact. With one exception, all of the proposed mappings result in (at most) 64 bit long outputs in order to allow atomic operations using CPUs with 64 bit registers. The mapping output size is restricted in the interest of performance. Additionally we demonstrate the benefits of the new mappings for one specific machine learning algorithm (k-means) and compare the algorithm's results for datasets with and without the proposed transformations.

AB To date, there are no reviews on machine learning (ML) for predicting outcomes in trauma. Consequently, it remains unclear as to how ML-based prediction models compare in the triage and assessment of trauma patients. The objective of this review was to survey and identify studies involving ML for predicting outcomes in trauma, with the hypothesis that models predicting similar outcomes may share common features but the performance of ML in these studies will differ greatly. MEDLINE and other databases were searched for studies involving trauma and ML. Sixty-five observational studies involving ML for the prediction of trauma outcomes met inclusion criteria. In total 2,433,180 patients were included in the studies. The studies focused on prediction of the following outcome measures: survival/mortality (n = 34), morbidity/shock/hemorrhage (n = 12), hospital length of stay (n = 7), hospital admission/triage (n = 6), traumatic brain injury (n = 4), life-saving interventions (n = 5), post-traumatic stress disorder (n = 4), and transfusion (n = 1). Six studies were prospective observational studies. Of the 65 studies, 33 used artificial neural networks for prediction. Importantly, most studies demonstrated the benefits of ML models. However, algorithm performance was assessed differently by different authors. Sensitivity-specificity gap values varied greatly from 0.035 to 0.927. Notably, studies shared many features for model development. A common ML feature base may be determined for predicting outcomes in trauma. However, the impact of ML will require further validation in prospective observational studies and randomized clinical trials, establishment of common performance criteria, and high-quality evidence about clinical and economic impacts before ML can be widely accepted in practice.

AB Predictive models are essential in dam safety assessment. Both deterministic and statistical models applied in the day-to-day practice have demonstrated to be useful, although they show relevant limitations at the same time. On another note, powerful learning algorithms have been developed in the field of machine learning (ML), which have been applied to solve practical problems. The work aims at testing the prediction capability of some state-of-the-art algorithms to model dam behaviour, in terms of displacements and leakage. Models based on random forests (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) are fitted to predict 14 target variables. Prediction accuracy is compared with the conventional statistical model, which shows poorer performance on average. BRT models stand out as the most accurate overall, followed, by NN and RF. It was also verified that the model fit can be improved by removing the records of the first years of dam functioning from the training set. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The prediction process is undertaken based on feature extraction and then on feature selection process. After selecting the relevant features, machine learning techniques like Support vector machine (SVM), Extreme learning machine (ELM) are applied for classification of the right kind of features. The results obtained with these classifiers are then tested using various test datasets like egfr, TP53, cosmic2plus etc, in order to identify cancer-associated mutations and passenger mutations i.e. neutral polymorphism.

DE Unsupervised learning; Entropy-based regularization; Orthonormality

AB In recent years deep learning paradigm achieved important empirical success in a number of practical applications such as object recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing. A lot of effort has been put on understanding theoretical aspects of this success, however, still there is no common view on how deep architectures should be trained and thus many open questions remain. One hypothesis focuses on formulating good criterion (prior) that may help to learn a set of features capable of disentangling hidden factors. Following this line of thinking, in this paper, we propose to add a penalty (regularization) term to the log-likelihood function that enforces hidden units to maximize entropy and to be pairwise uncorrelated, for given observables. We hypothesize that the proposed framework for learning informative features results in more discriminative data representation that maintains its generative capabilities. In order to verify our hypothesis we apply the regularization term to the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and carry out empirical study on three classification problems: character recognition, object recognition, and document classification. The experiments confirm that the proposed approach indeed increases discriminative and generative performance in comparison to RBM trained without any regularization and with the weight-decay, the sparse regularization, the max-norm regularization, Dropout and Dropconnect.

AB Data Mining and Machine Learning is one of the most popular research areas in computer science that is relevant in today's world of unfathomable data. To keep up with the rising size of data, there arises a need to quickly extract knowledge from data sources to aid data analysis research and improve industry and market needs. Primary Data Mining algorithms like k-means, Apriori, PageRank etc. are used today, but Machine Learning techniques can enhance the same by learning from the complex patterns. This paper focuses on the various existing approaches where Machine Learning algorithms have been used to improve data classification and pattern recognition in Data Mining especially for Feature Selection. It compares and contrasts the existing techniques and finds out the best one among them. Further, the paper proposes a heuristic approach to theoretically overcome most of the limitations in existing algorithms.

Recent developments in machine learning techniques for anomaly detection enable the implementation of more sophisticated systems that aim to augment current state-of-the-art mission tools to provide valuable decision support for the spacecraft operators, assisting in anomaly detection and potentially saving console time for the engineers. We will show results of the implementation of an anomaly detection tool for the NASA Mars Science Laboratory mission.

AB Infection by dengue-virus is prevalent and a public health issue in tropical countries worldwide. Also, in developing nations, child populations remain at risk of adverse events following an infection by dengue virus, as the necessary care is not always accessible, or health professionals are without means to cheaply and reliably predict how likely is for a patient to experience severe Dengue. Here, we propose a classification model based on Machine Learning techniques, which predicts whether or not a pediatric patient will be admitted into the pediatric Intensive Care Unit, as a proxy for Dengue severity. Different Machine Learning techniques were trained and validated using Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation, and the best model was evaluated on a disjoint test set. Cross-Validation results showed an SVM with Gaussian Kernel outperformed the other models considered, with an 0.81 Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) score. Subsequent results over the test set showed a 0.75 ROC AUC score. Validation and test results are promising and support further research and development.

AB The electroencephalography (EEG) is the most essential tool for the diagnosis and the treatment of the epilepsy. It allows observing events strongly associated with epilepsy or epileptic spikes and locating the brain regions that cause the symptoms of epilepsy. This paper presents an automated classification of EEG signals for the detection of epileptic seizures with Single-Channel using the wavelet transform and the Extreme Learning Machine. The aim is to create a system with reduced computation time and resources with the minimum number of required electrodes. The decision making process is comprised of three steps: (a) Preprocessing, (b) feature extraction based on the wavelet transform, and (c) classification by the Extreme Learning Machine. The proposed algorithm has been tested on three different data sets from the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database using only the FT10-T8 channel. The proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 94.85%.

AB In the paper, we examine the general regression problem under the missing data scenario. In order to provide reliable estimates for the regression function (approximation), a novel methodology based on Gaussian Mixture Model and Extreme Learning Machine is developed. Gaussian Mixture Model is used to model the data distribution which is adapted to handle missing values, while Extreme Learning Machine enables to devise a multiple imputation strategy for final estimation. With multiple imputation and ensemble approach over many Extreme Learning Machines, final estimation is improved over the mean imputation performed only once to complete the data. The proposed methodology has longer running times compared to simple methods, but the overall increase in accuracy justifies this trade-off. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Joint Label Consistent Dictionary Learning and Adaptive Label Prediction

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS

DT Article
DE Dictionary learning; label prediction; machine fault classification;
   semisupervised learning
ID K-SVD; SPARSE; DIAGNOSIS
AB In this paper, we propose a semisupervised label consistent dictionary learning (SSDL) framework for machine fault classification. SSDL is a semisupervised extension of recent fully supervised label consistent dictionary learning approach, since the number of labeled machine data is usually limited in practice. To enable the supervised dictionary learning model to use both labeled and commonly readily available unlabeled data for enhancing performance, we propose to incorporate the merits of label prediction and present a joint label consistent dictionary learning and adaptive label prediction technique. In this setting, we first employ the existing label prediction model to estimate the labels of unlabeled training signals in a transductive fashion for enriching supervised prior. Then, we use predicted labeled data for label consistent dictionary learning. After that, we apply the discriminant sparse codes as the adaptive reconstruction weights for label prediction to update the estimated labels of unlabeled training data and the discriminative sparse codes matrix for label consistent dictionary learning so that classification performance can be enhanced. Thus, an informative dictionary, a sparse-code matrix, and an optimal multiclass classifier can be alternately obtained from one objective function. Besides, the tricky process of choosing optimal kernel width and neighborhood size can also be effectively voided in our scheme due to the adaptive weights. Extensive simulations on several machine fault datasets show that our SSDL method can deliver enhanced performance over other state-of-the-arts for machine fault classification.

AB Fixed placements of inertial sensors have been utilized by previous human activity recognition algorithms to train the classifier. However, the distribution of sensor data is seriously affected by the sensor placement. The performance will be degraded when the model trained on one placement is used in others. In order to tackle this problem, a fast and robust human activity recognition model called TransM-RKELM (Transfer learning mixed and reduced kernel Extreme Learning Machine) is proposed in this paper; It uses a kernel fusion method to reduce the influence by the'choice of kernel function and the reduced kernel is utilized to reduce the computational cost. After realizing initial activity recognition model by mixed and reduced kernel extreme learning model (M-RKELM), in the online phase M-RKELM is utilized to classify the activity and adapt the model to new locations based on high confident recognition results in real time. Experimental results show that the proposed model can adapt the classifier to new sensor locations quickly and obtain good recognition performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB E-Learning systems based on Affective computing are popularly used for emotional/behavioral analysis of the users. Emotions expressed by the user is depicted by detecting the facial expression of the user and accordingly the teaching strategies will be changed. The present eLearning systems mainly focus on the single user face detection. Hence, in this paper, we propose multiuser face detection based eLearning system using support vector machine based supervised machine learning technique. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system provides the accuracy of 89% to 100% w.r.t different datasets (LFW, FDDB, and YFD). Further, to improve the speed of emotional feature processing, we used GPU along with the CPU and thereby achieve a speedup factor of 2.

AB Research in Machine Learning has increased dramatically over the past couple of decades, with applications greatly benefitting industry. These applications vary widely in the fields of space exploration technologies, transportation, robotics, agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine and finance. However, the agricultural and animal husbandry related applications are relatively few when compared to other fields. This paper reviews the past and present calf weaning strategies mainly focussing on the incorporation of Machine Learning techniques in classifying the behavioural responses in cattle and makes an attempt to extend the scope of machine learning classification applications related to calf weaning. This review further discusses the integration of relevant sensors (sensor fusion), deep learning and the improvement of prediction accuracy.

AB Healthcare is an integral component in people's lives, especially for the rising elderly population, and must be affordable. Medicare is one such healthcare program. Claims fraud is a major contributor to increased healthcare costs, but its impact can be lessened through fraud detection. In this paper, we compare several machine learning methods to detect Medicare fraud. We perform a comparative study with supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid machine learning approaches using four performance metrics and class imbalance reduction via oversampling and an 80-20 undersampling method. We group the 2015 Medicare data into provider types, with fraud labels from the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities database. Our results show that the successful detection of fraudulent providers is possible, with the 80-20 sampling method demonstrating the best performance across the learners. Furthermore, supervised methods performed better than unsupervised or hybrid methods, but these results varied based on the class imbalance sampling technique and provider type.

AB Data-driven models, and maturating data-treatment tools, now allow for automation in a wide range of domains. The data-rich domain that is NC machining presents a strong potential for automation, in this regard, and the smart factory calls for knowledge capitalisation in manufacturing.
   The field of machining saw numerous data formats, and is still led by heterogeneous sources. To exploit this massive amount of data, capitalisation of information from those sources is compulsory. Such system should allow aggregation of different sources and formats, and accommodate for information about diverse elements regarding manufacturing Parts, tools, machines...
   In this paper, automated process planning generation methods are reviewed. The localisation and formalisation of data in manufacturing documents is considered, and emphasis is made on linking trajectories and features, to define strategies. Attempts to use machine learning techniques in manufacturing are reviewed, and the lack thereof in manufacturing knowledge retrieval is underlined.
   Then, a framework is proposed to realise knowledge retrieval from legacy programs, and several locks and improvement possibilities are identified.

ID NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
AB Machine learning and Statistical techniques are powerful analysis tools yet to be incorporated in the new multidisciplinary field diversely termed as natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistic. The linguistic knowledge may be ambiguous or contains ambiguity; therefore, various NLP tasks are carried out in order to resolve the ambiguity in speech and language processing. The current prevailing techniques for addressing various NLP tasks as a supervised learning are hidden Markov models (HMM), conditional random field (CRF), maximum entropy models (MaxEnt), support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bays, and deep learning (DL). The goal of this survey paper is to highlight ambiguity in speech and language processing, to provide brief overview of basic categories of linguistic knowledge, to discuss different existing machine learning models and their classification into different categories and finally to provide a comprehensive review of different state of the art machine learning models with the goal that new researchers look into these techniques and depending on these, develops advance techniques. In this survey we reviewed how avant-grademachine learning models can help in this dilemma.

AB The rapid development of web applications has created many security problems related to intrusions not just on computer, network systems, but also on web applications themselves. In Web Intrusion Systems (WIS), most techniques used nowadays are not able to deal with the dynamic and complex nature of cyber-attacks on web applications and related issues. However, web intrusion techniques based on machine learning approaches with statistical analysis of data enable autonomous detect intrusive and non-intrusive traffic with low false-positive errors. In this paper, we present the survey of various machine learning techniques used to build WIS. In addition, we develop the experimental framework for comparative analysis of some machine learning techniques applying on the well-known benchmark data set - CSIC 2010 HTTP [13].

AB We present a framework of fast machine learning algorithms in the context of largesized hyperspectral images classification from the theoretical to a practical viewpoint. In particular, we assess the performance of random forest (RF), rotation forest (RoF), and extreme learning machine (ELM) and the ensembles of RF and ELM. These classifiers are applied to two large-sized hyperspectral images and compared to the support vector machines. To give the quantitative analysis, we pay attention to comparing these methods when working with high input dimensions and a limited/sufficient training set. Moreover, other important issues such as the computational cost and robustness against the noise are also discussed. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB The massive growth of data volume within the healthcare sector pushes the current classical systems that were adapted to the limit. Recent studies have focused on the use of machine learning methods to develop healthcare systems to extract knowledge from data by means of analysing, mining, pattern recognition, classification and prediction. Our research study reviews and examines different supervised machine learning classifiers using headache dataset. Different statistical measures have been used to evaluate the performance of seven well-known classifiers. The experimental study indicated that Decision Tree classifier achieved a better overall performance, followed by Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighbor. This would determine the most suitable classifier for developing a particular classification system that is capable of identifying primary headache disorders.

AB Quality monitoring and prediction plays a key role in improving product quality and achieving automated quality control in manufacturing processes such as the abrasion-resistant material manufacturing process. Traditional methods that rely on the use of first-principle models are difficult to formulate due to the increasing complexity and high dimensionality of manufacturing processes. Data-driven machine learning methods offer an efficient way to learn models for quality prediction, in which the meaningful process information can be learned directly from large amounts of measured process data at different stages. In this paper, based on data collected throughout an abrasion-resistant material manufacturing process, product quality prediction of burned balls is achieved with the use of the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm.

ID SPOOFING DETECTION
AB Most physical-layer authentication techniques use hypothesis tests to compare the radio channel information with the channel record of Alice to detect spoofer Eve in wireless networks. However, the test threshold in the hypothesis test is not always available, especially in dynamic networks. In this letter, we propose a physical-layer authentication scheme based on extreme learning machine that exploit multi-dimensional characters of radio channels and use the training data generated from the spoofing model to improve the spoofing detection accuracy. Simulation results show that our proposed technique can significantly improve the authentication accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art method.

AB A wide range of opportunities are emerging in the micro-system technology sector for laser micro-machining systems, because they are capable of processing various types of materials with micro-scale precision. However, few process datasets and machine-learning techniques are optimized for this industrial task. This study describes the process parameters of micro-laser milling and their influence on the final features of the microshapes that are produced. It also identifies the most accurate machine-learning technique for the modelization of this multivariable process. It examines the capabilities of laser micro-machining by performing experiments on hardened steel with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Arrays of micro-channels were manufactured using various scanning speeds, pulse intensities and pulse frequencies. The results are presented in terms of the main industrial requirements for any manufactured good: dimensional accuracy (in our case, depth and width of the channels), surface roughness and material removal rate (which is a measure of the productivity of the process). Different machine-learning techniques were then tested on the datasets to build highly accurate models for each output variable. The selected techniques were: k-Nearest Neighbours, neural networks, decision trees and linear regression models. Our analysis of the correlation coefficients and the mean absolute error of all the generated models show that neural networks are better at modelling channel depth and that decision trees are better at modelling material removal rate; both techniques were similar for width and surface roughness. In general, these two techniques show better accuracy than the other two models. The work concludes that decision trees should be used, if information on input parameter relations is sought, while neural networks are suitable when the dimensional accuracy of the workpiece is the main industrial requirement. Extensive datasets are necessary for this industrial task, to provide reliable AI models due to the high rates of noise, especially for some outputs such as roughness.

AB Accurate and timely predicting values of performance parameters are currently strongly needed for important complex equipment in engineering. In time series prediction, two problems are urgent to be solved. One problem is how to achieve the accuracy, stability and efficiency together, and the other is how to handle time series with multiple regimes. To solve these two problems, random forests-based extreme learning machine ensemble model and a novel multi-regime approach are proposed respectively, and these two approaches can be integrated to achieve better performance. First, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is used in the proposed model because of its efficiency. Then the regularized ELM and ensemble learning strategy are used to improve generalization performance and prediction accuracy. The bootstrap sampling technique is used to generate training sample sets for multiple base-level ELM models, and then the random forests (RF) model is used as the combiner to aggregate these ELM models to achieve more accurate and stable performance. Next, based on the specific properties of turbofan engine time series, a multi-regime approach is proposed to handle it. Regimes are first separated, then the proposed RF-based ELM ensemble model is used to learn models of all regimes, individually, and last, all the learned regime models are aggregated to predict performance parameter at the future timestamp. The proposed RF-based ELM ensemble model and multi-regime approaches are evaluated by using NN3 time series and NASA turbofan engine time series, and then the proposed model is applied to the exhaust gas temperature prediction of CFM engine. The results demonstrate that the proposed RF-based ELM ensemble model and multi-regime approach can be accurate, stable and efficient in predicting multi-regime time series, and it can be robust against overfitting.

AB The idea of service oriented architecture (SOA) and the wide adoption of the cloud computing cause the rapid advancement of web applications. Also the constantly increasing expectations of end-users concerning the usability of graphical interfaces have become a driving force for new information and communication technologies. However, as new technologies, frameworks and software solutions are created, it often happens that accidentally software flaws are introduced. In many cases, those flaws may have serious implications, such as privileges escalation, server and client sides infection with the malware or sensitive data leakage. Therefore, recent cyber incidents concerning web applications show that the new countermeasures are needed in order to protect the web layer. In this paper we propose the method that adapts the Extreme Learning Machine to solve the two class classification problem in the Web Layer Anomaly Detection domain. Our experiments give promising results proving that this technique can be used to effectively detect cyber attacks targeting web applications.

AB Background: Functional networks play an important role in the analysis of biological processes and systems. The inference of these networks from high-throughput (-omics) data is an area of intense research. So far, the similarity-based inference paradigm (e.g. gene co-expression) has been the most popular approach. It assumes a functional relationship between genes which are expressed at similar levels across different samples. An alternative to this paradigm is the inference of relationships from the structure of machine learning models. These models are able to capture complex relationships between variables, that often are different/complementary to the similarity-based methods.
   Results: We propose a protocol to infer functional networks from machine learning models, called FuNeL. It assumes, that genes used together within a rule-based machine learning model to classify the samples, might also be functionally related at a biological level. The protocol is first tested on synthetic datasets and then evaluated on a test suite of 8 real-world datasets related to human cancer. The networks inferred from the real-world data are compared against gene co-expression networks of equal size, generated with 3 different methods. The comparison is performed from two different points of view. We analyse the enriched biological terms in the set of network nodes and the relationships between known disease-associated genes in a context of the network topology. The comparison confirms both the biological relevance and the complementary character of the knowledge captured by the FuNeL networks in relation to similarity-based methods and demonstrates its potential to identify known disease associations as core elements of the network. Finally, using a prostate cancer dataset as a case study, we confirm that the biological knowledge captured by our method is relevant to the disease and consistent with the specialised literature and with an independent dataset not used in the inference process.

AB Many investment professionals consider academic research instrumental in improving the quality of the investment process. However, it is hard to extract investment insights from the vast and rapidly expanding research corpus, which requires a large amount of time and human effort in order to absorb. We offer a novel solution to this problem by introducing a machine learning approach to research curation. By comparing the performance and accuracy of humans and machines, we show that a machine learning approach approximates the quality of human curation but offers the strategic benefits of scalability, efficiency and lower cost.

AB Industrial Control System (ICS) is used to monitor and control critical infrastructures. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are major components of ICS, which are used to form automation system. It is important to protect PLCs from any attacks and undesired incidents. However, it is not easy to apply traditional tools and techniques to PLCs for security protection and forensics because of its unique architectures. Semi-supervised machine learning algorithm, One-class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), has been applied successfully to many anomaly detection problems. This paper proposes a novel methodology to detect anomalous events of PLC by using OCSVM. The methodology was applied to a simulated traffic light control system to illustrate its effectiveness and accuracy. Our results show that high accuracy of identification of anomalous PLC operations is obtained which can help investigators to perform PLC forensics efficiently and effectively.

SO NEUROCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Extreme learning machine; Graph Laplacian; Manifold regularization; Face
   recognition
AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been proposed as a new algorithm for training single hidden layer feed forward neural networks. The main merit of ELM lies in the fact that the input weights as well as hidden layer bias are randomly generated and thus the output weights can be obtained analytically, which can overcome the drawbacks incurred by gradient-based training algorithms such as local optima, improper learning rate and low learning speed. Based on the consistency property of data, which enforces similar samples to share similar properties, we propose a discriminative graph regularized Extreme Learning Machine (GELM) for further enhancing its classification performance in this paper. In the proposed GELM model, the label information of training samples are used to construct an adjacent graph and correspondingly the graph regularization term is formulated to constrain the output weights to learn similar outputs for samples from the same class. The proposed GELM model also has a closed form solution as the standard ELM and thus the output weights can be obtained efficiently. Experiments on several widely used face databases show that our proposed GELM can achieve much performance gain over standard ELM and regularized ELM. Moreover, GELM also performs well when compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods for face recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB the application of machine learning models such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) in predicting reservoir properties has been effective in the recent years when compared with the traditional empirical methods. Despite that the machine learning models suffer a lot in the faces of uncertain data which is common characteristics of well log dataset. The reason for uncertainty in well log dataset includes a missing scale, data interpretation and measurement error problems. Feature Selection aimed at selecting feature subset that is relevant to the predicting property. In this paper a feature selection based on mutual information criterion is proposed, the strong point of this method relies on the choice of threshold based on statistically sound criterion for the typical greedy feedforward method of feature selection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is capable of improving the performance of the machine learning models in terms of prediction accuracy and reduction in training time.

AB Volcanic eruptions cause significant loss of lives and property around the world each year. Their importance is highlighted by the sheer number of volcanoes for which eruptive activity is probable. These volcanoes are classified as in a state of unrest. The Global Volcano Project maintained by the Smithsonian Institution estimates that approximately 600 volcanoes, many proximal to major urban areas, are currently in this state of unrest. A spectrum of phenomena serve as precursors to eruption, including ground deformation, emission of gases, and seismic activity. The precursors are caused by magma upwelling from the Moho to the shallow (2-5 km) subsurface and magma movement in the volcano conduit immediately preceding eruption.
   Precursors have in common the fundamental petrologic processes of melt generation in the lithosphere and subsequent magma differentiation. Our ultimate objective is to apply stateof- the-art machine learning techniques to volcano eruption forecasting. In this paper, we applied machine learning techniques to the precursor data, such as the 1999 eruption of Redoubt volcano, Alaska, for which a comprehensive record of precursor activity exists as USGS public domain files and global data bases, such as the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanology Project and Aerocom (which is part of the HEMCO data base). As a result, we get geophysically meaningful results.

AB The emergence and growth of cloud computing has made a serious impact on the IT industry in recent years with large companies starting to offer powerful, reliable and cost-efficient platforms for businesses to build and reshape their business models. Showing no sign of slowing down, cloud computing capabilities now include machine learning, with facilities for both designing and deploying models. With this capability of machine learning using cloud computing comes the increasing need to be able to classify whether an incoming connection is from a legitimate originating IP address or if it is being sent through an intermediary like a web proxy. Taking inspiration from Intrusion Detection Systems that make use of machine learning capabilities to improve anomaly detection accuracy, this paper proposes that cloud based machine learning can be used in order to detect and classify web proxy usage by capturing packet data and feeding it into a cloud based machine learning web service.

AB During the natural language communication, meaning understanding is the complex task that humans learn from their childhood but to automate this process of meaning understanding for computers has great real world applications. Simple text processing tasks are not enough to uncover the meaning from given unstructured natural language text. Our current research focuses on the issues pertaining to the same. Paraphrase identification is such important task of identifying the meaning similarity between two text segments in natural language understanding system. Proposed a machine learning system uses lexical features and dependency based features for sentence level paraphrase identification. The performance of proposed system is evaluated by conducting experiment on standard Microsoft paraphrase corpus. Moreover, a comparative study of current system with other machine learning based systems on Microsoft paraphrase corpus for paraphrase identification is carried out. The proposed system achieves competitive results compare to other state-of-the art machine learning systems by using simple linguistic features. The system using SVM classifier achieves 81.41% f-score by using simple lexical features only. Voting based classifier scores 80.97% with lexical features. Results with dependency features are highly sensitive to minor syntactic change.

AB This paper deals with the problem of airfare prices prediction. For this purpose a set of features characterizing a typical flight is decided, supposing that these features affect the price of an air ticket. The features are applied to eight state of the art machine learning (ML) models, used to predict the air tickets prices, and the performance of the models is compared to each other. Along with the prediction accuracy of each model, this paper studies the dependency of the accuracy on the feature set used to represent an airfare. For the experiments a novel dataset consisting of 1814 data flights of the Aegean Airlines for a specific international destination (from Thessaloniki to Stuttgart) is constructed and used to train each ML model. The derived experimental results reveal that the ML models are able to handle this regression problem with almost 88% accuracy, for a certain type of flight features.

AB Data stream mining has been receiving increased attention due to its presence in a wide range of applications, such as sensor networks, banking, and telecommunication. One of the most important challenges during learning from data streams is reacting to concept drift, i.e. unforeseen changes of the stream's underlying data distribution. Traditional methods always used online learning to handle the concept drift problem. However, online learning requires high time cost during online training. To overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Kalman filtering approach, which can provide robust concept drift detection, to track concept drift. Once concept drift happens, the online extreme learning machine is applied to update the tracking model, whereas the offline extreme learning machine is used when no concept drift occurs. Based on this idea, we propose a fusion framework to combine online and offline extreme learning machine to efficiently track the data stream. The experiment results indicate the superior performance of our method.

AB Leveraging machine learning has been proven as a promising avenue for addressing many practical circuit design and verification challenges. We demonstrate a novel active learning guided machine learning approach for characterizing circuit performance. When employed under the context of support vector machines (SVMs), the proposed probabilistically weighted active learning approach is able to dramatically reduce the size of the training data, leading to significant reduction of the overall training cost. The proposed active learning approach is extended to the training of asymmetric SVM classifiers, which is further sped up by a global acceleration scheme. We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed techniques using four case studies: 1) dc/dc converter ripple noise analysis; 2) phase-locked loop lock-time verification; 3) reliability analysis of a ring oscillator with respect to process variations and initial conditions; and 4) prediction of chip peak temperature using a limited number of on-chip temperature sensors.

AB The main issue in computer vision and notably image classification problems is image feature extraction and image encoding. Here we show and compare two approaches to solve this problem: the first approach uses the Bag of Features (BoF) paradigm. The second one is based on deep learning and especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Specifically, we use the "AlexNet" CNN model trained to perform well on the ImageNet dataset. Our results shed light on how the use of CNN is more performant than the BoF in the process of feature extraction in a machine learning framework for image classification. This performance is shown by a series of experimentations that we carried out using the Caltech dataset and many classifier algorithms.
