AB Healthcare is particularly rich in semantic information and background knowledge describing data. This paper discusses a number of semantic data types that can be found in healthcare data, presents how the semantics can be extracted from existing sources including the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), discusses how the semantics can be used in both supervised and unsupervised learning, and presents an example rule learning system that implements several of these types. Results from three example applications in the healthcare domain are used to further exemplify semantic data types.

AB We have developed a machine learning toolbox, called SHOGUN, which is designed for unified large-scale learning for a broad range of feature types and learning settings. It offers a considerable number of machine learning models such as support vector machines, hiddenMarkov models, multiple kernel learning, linear discriminant analysis, and more. Most of the specific algorithms are able to deal with several different data classes. We have used this toolbox in several applications from computational biology, some of them coming with no less than 50 million training examples and others with 7 billion test examples. With more than a thousand installations worldwide, SHOGUN is already widely adopted in the machine learning community and beyond. SHOGUN is implemented in C++ and interfaces to MATLAB (TM), R, Octave, Python, and has a stand-alone command line interface.

AB Computational intelligence techniques have been used in wide applications. Out of numerous computational intelligence techniques, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) have been playing the dominant roles. However, it is known that both neural networks and SVMs face some challenging issues such as: (1) slow learning speed, (2) trivial human intervene, and/or (3) poor computational scalability. Extreme learning machine (ELM) as emergent technology which overcomes some challenges faced by other techniques has recently attracted the attention from more and more researchers. ELM works for generalized single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs). The essence of ELM is that the hidden layer of SLFNs need not be tuned. Compared with those traditional computational intelligence techniques, ELM provides better generalization performance at a much faster learning speed and with least human intervene. This paper gives a survey on ELM and its variants, especially on (1) batch learning mode of ELM, (2) fully complex ELM, (3) online sequential ELM, (4) incremental ELM, and (5) ensemble of ELM.

Machine learning can be used to enable greater autonomy to improve the duration, reliability, cost-effectiveness, and science return of space missions. In addition to the challenges provided by the nature of space itself, the requirements of a space mission severely limit the use of many current machine learning approaches, and we encourage researchers to explore new ways to address these challenges.

AB Ensemble methods have gained considerable attention from machine learning and soft computing communities in the last years. There are several practical and theoretical reasons, mainly statistical reasons, why an ensemble may be preferred. A set of learners with similar training performance may have different generalization performance, when exposed to sparse data, large volume of data or data fusion. The basic idea of an ensemble learning algorithm is to build a predictive model by combining a set of learning hypotheses instead of laboriously designing the complete map between inputs and responses in a single step. Ensemble based systems have shown to produce favorable results compared to those of single-expert system for a broad range of applications such as financial, medical and social models, network security, web mining or bioinformatics, to name a few. The focus of this chapter will be on ensembles for classification and regression estimation. Design, implementation and application will be the main topics of the chapter. Specifically, conditions under which ensemble based systems may be more beneficial than their single machine, algorithms for generating individual components of ensemble systems and various procedures through which the individual classifiers can be combined. Finally, future research directions will be included, like incremental learning, machine fusion, and other areas in which ensemble of machines have shown great promise.

AB Machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have in the past years developed to become a working horse in brain imaging and the computational neurosciences, as they are instrumental for mining vast amounts of neural data of ever increasing measurement precision and detecting minuscule signals from an overwhelming noise floor. They provide the means to decode and characterize task relevant brain states and to distinguish them from non-informative brain signals. While undoubtedly this machinery has helped to gain novel biological insights, it also holds the danger of potential unintentional abuse. Ideally machine learning techniques should be usable for any non-expert, however, unfortunately they are typically not. Overfitting and other pitfalls may occur and lead to spurious and nonsensical interpretation. The goal of this review is therefore to provide an accessible and clear introduction to the strengths and also the inherent dangers of machine learning usage in the neurosciences.

AB In this paper, we give a short introduction to machine learning and survey its applications in radiology. We focused on six categories of applications in radiology: medical image segmentation, registration, computer aided detection and diagnosis, brain function or activity analysis and neurological disease diagnosis from fMR images, content-based image retrieval systems for CT or MRI images, and text analysis of radiology reports using natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU). This survey shows that machine learning plays a key role in many radiology applications. Machine learning identifies complex patterns automatically and helps radiologists make intelligent decisions on radiology data such as conventional radiographs, CT, MRI, and PET images and radiology reports. In many applications, the performance of machine learning-based automatic detection and diagnosis systems has shown to be comparable to that of a well-trained and experienced radiologist. Technology development in machine learning and radiology will benefit from each other in the long run. Key contributions and common characteristics of machine learning techniques in radiology are discussed.

AB The aim of this paper is to investigate the quality of methodology in software fault prediction studies using machine learning. Over two hundred studies of fault prediction have been published in the last 10 years. There is evidence to suggest that the quality of methodology used in some of these studies does not allow us to have confidence in the predictions reported by them. We evaluate the machine learning methodology used in 21 fault prediction studies. All of these studies use NASA data sets. We score each study from 1 to 10 in terms of the quality of their machine learning methodology (e.g. whether or not studies report randomising their cross validation folds). Only 10 out of the 21 studies scored 5 or more out of 10. Furthermore 1 study scored only 1 out of 10. When we plot these scores over time there is no evidence that the quality of machine learning methodology is better in recent studies. Our results suggest that there remains much to be done by both researchers and reviewers to improve the quality of machine learning methodology used in software fault prediction. We conclude that the results reported in some studies need to be treated with caution.

AB Many learning algorithms perform poorly when the training data are incomplete. One standard approach involves first imputing the missing values, then giving the completed data to the learning algorithm. However, this is especially problematic when the features are nominal. This work presents "classifier-based nominal imputation" (CNI), an easy-to-implement and effective nominal imputation technique that views nominal imputation as classification: it learns a classifier for each feature (that maps the other features of an instance to the predicted value of that feature), then uses that classifier to predict themissing values of that feature. Our empirical results show that learners that preprocess their incomplete training data using CNI using support vector machine or decision tree learners have significantly higher predictive accuracy than learners that (1) do not use preprocessing, (2) use baseline imputation techniques, or (3) use this CNI preprocessor with other classification algorithms. This improvement is especially apparent when the base learner is instance-based. CNI is also found helpful for other base learners, such as naive Bayes and decision tree, on incomplete nominal data.

AB In this paper we introduce the LeGO (Learning for Global Optimization) approach for global optimization in which machine learning is used to predict the outcome of a computationally expensive global optimization run, based upon a suitable training performed by standard runs of the same global optimization method. We propose to use a Support Vector Machine (although different machine learning tools might be employed) to learn the relationship between the starting point of an algorithm and the final outcome (which is usually related to the function value at the point returned by the procedure). Numerical experiments performed both on classical test functions and on difficult space trajectory planning problems show that the proposed approach can be very effective in identifying good starting points for global optimization.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) as a new learning algorithm has been proposed for single-hidden layer feed-forward neural networks, ELM can overcome many drawbacks in the traditional gradient-based learning algorithm such as local minimal, improper learning rate, and low learning speed by randomly selecting input weights and hidden layer bias. However, ELM suffers from instability and over-fitting, especially on large datasets. In this paper, a dynamic ensemble extreme learning machine based on sample entropy is proposed, which can alleviate to some extent the problems of instability and over-fitting, and increase the prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is robust and efficient.

AB Extreme learning machine not only has the best generalization performance but also has simple structure and convenient calculation. In this paper, its merits are used for reinforcement learning. The use of extreme learning machine on Q function approximation can improve the speed of reinforcement learning. As the number of hidden layer nodes is equal to that of samples, the larger sample size will seriously affect the learning speed. To solve this problem, a rolling time-window mechanism is introduced to the algorithm, which can reduce the size of the sample space to a certain extent. Finally, our algorithm is compared with a reinforcement learning based on a traditional BP neural network using a boat problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is faster and more effective.

AB Extreme learning machines are single-hidden layer feed-forward neural networks, where the training is restricted to the output weights in order to achieve fast learning with good performance. The success of learning strongly depends on the random parameter initialization. To overcome the problem of unsuited initialization ranges, a novel and efficient pretraining method to adapt extreme learning machines task-specific is presented. The pretraining aims at desired output distributions of the hidden neurons. It leads to better performance and less dependence on the size of the hidden layer.

That adaptability is also a vulnerability: attackers can exploit machine learning systems. We present a taxonomy identifying and analyzing attacks against machine learning systems. We show how these classes influence the costs for the attacker and defender, and we give a formal structure defining their interaction. We use our framework to survey and analyze the literature of attacks against machine learning systems. We also illustrate our taxonomy by showing how it can guide attacks against SpamBayes, a popular statistical spam filter. Finally, we discuss how our taxonomy suggests new lines of defenses.

AB We applied a learning methodology framework to assist in the threshold-based segmentation of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours in positron-emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging for use in radiotherapy planning. Gated and standard free-breathing studies of two patients were independently analysed (four studies in total). Each study had a PET-CT and a treatment-planning CT image. The reference gross tumour volume (GTV) was identified by two experienced radiation oncologists who also determined reference standardized uptake value (SUV) thresholds that most closely approximated the GTV contour on each slice. A set of uptake distribution-related attributes was calculated for each pet slice. A machine learning algorithm was trained on a subset of the pet slices to cope with slice-to-slice variation in the optimal SUV threshold: that is, to predict the most appropriate SUV threshold from the calculated attributes for each slice. The algorithm's performance was evaluated using the remainder of the pet slices. A high degree of geometric similarity was achieved between the areas outlined by the predicted and the reference SUV thresholds (Jac-card index exceeding 0.82). No significant difference was found between the gated and the free-breathing results in the same patient. In this preliminary work, we demonstrated the potential applicability of a machine learning methodology as an auxiliary tool for radiation treatment planning in NSCLC.

AB For financial institutions, it is very important to have the ability to predict or forecast business failure. Incorrect decision making is likely to cause financial distress or crises. Bankruptcy prediction is a major research problem in the accounting and finance domain. In other words, it would be very useful if financial institutions have a prediction model which is able to predict whether the loan customers would be bankrupt or not. Using machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, decision trees, etc. to develop bankruptcy prediction models has been extensively studied since the 1990s. This chapter reviews 27 related journal papers in the period between 2000 and 2007 focusing on developing hybrid and ensemble classifiers. Related studies are compared by their classifier design, datasets used, and other experimental setups. Current achievements and limitations in developing bankruptcy prediction models by machine learning are present and discussed. A number of future research directions are also provided.

AB Credit Scoring has become an oft researched topic in light of the increasing volatility of the global economy and the recent world financial crisis. Amidst the many methods used for credit scoring, machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular due to their efficient and accurate nature and relative simplicity. Furthermore machine learning techniques minimize the risk of human bias and error and maximize speed as they are able to perform computationally difficult tasks in very short times. In this work, a comparative analysis is performed between two machine learning techniques namely Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks. This study compares both techniques in terms of accuracy, computational complexity and processing times. In order to assure meaningful comparisons, a real world dataset precisely the Australian Credit Scoring data set is used for this task. Obtained experimental results show that although both machine learning techniques can be applied successfully, Artificial Neural Networks slightly outperform Support Vector Machines.

AB This paper examined the application of Machine Learning techniques for famine prediction. Early detection of famine reduces vulnerability of the society at risk. The dataset used in the study was collected between 2004 to 2005 across households in the different regions of Uganda. Dataset from the northern region was found to be most suitable to training datasets of other regions. Classification performance of four methods as Support Vector Machine, K- Nearest Neighbours, Naive Bayes and Decision tree in prediction of famine were evaluated. Support Vector Machine and K- Nearest Neighbours performed better than the rest of the methods however Support Vector Machine produced the best ROC which can be used by policy makers to determine the cut-off for determining famine prone households. It is recommended in this study that satellite data could be used in combination to show the relationship in prediction of food security as this may increase the specificity of those households at risk.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) was proposed as a new class of learning algorithm for single-hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN). To achieve good generalization performance, ELM minimizes training error on the entire training data set, therefore it might suffer from overfitting as the learning model will approximate all training samples well. In this letter, an ensemble based ELM (EN-ELM) algorithm is proposed where ensemble learning and cross-validation are embedded into the training phase so as to alleviate the overtraining problem and enhance the predictive stability. Experimental results on several benchmark databases demonstrate that EN-ELM is robust and efficient for classification.

We first present some illustrative experiments in robot learning in the XPERO European project. Then we formulate criteria for a comparison of learning methods and a systematic list of types of learning or discovery tasks, and discuss the suitability of chosen ML methods for these tasks.

AB Recently, learning effects in scheduling problems have received growing attention. The position-based learning model seems to be a realistic assumption for the case where the actual processing of the job is mainly machine driven. In this paper, we consider the sum-of-processing-time-based learning model. We propose a learning model with considers both the machine and human learning effects, simultaneously. We first show that the position-based learning and the sum-of-processing-time-based learning models in the literature are special cases of the proposed model. Moreover, we present the solution procedures for some single-machine and some flowshop problems. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Boosting ensemble algorithm exhibits two fatal limitations: one is that it gives in advance the upper bound of weighted error on weak learning algorithm; the other one is that it is overdependent on data and weak learning machine, and it is too sensitive to data noising. Aimed at limitation of Boosting ensemble application in extreme learning machine, this paper proposes a new algorithm: evolutionary extreme learning machine based on dynamic Adaboost ensemble, which regards the evolutionary extreme learning machine as weak learning machine, dynamic Adaboost ensemble algorithm is used to integrate the outputs of weak learning machines, and makes use of fuzzy activation function as activation function of evolutionary extreme learning machine because of low computational burden and easy implementation in hardware. Proposed algorithm has been successfully applied to problem of function approximation and classification application. Experimental results show that the algorithm increases the training speed greatly when dealing with large dataset and has better generalization performance compared to extreme learning machine, evolutionary extreme learning machine and Boosting ensemble extreme learning machine with quasi-Newton algorithms.

AB We consider the problem of intrusion detection in a computer network, and investigate the use of extreme learning machines (ELMs) to classify and detect the intrusions. With increasing connectivity between networks, the risk of information systems to external attacks or intrusions has increased tremendously. Machine learning methods like support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks have been widely used for intrusion detection. These methods generally suffer from long training times, require parameter tuning, or do not perform well in multi-class classification. We propose a basic ELM method based on random features, and a kernel based ELM method for classification. We compare our methods with commonly used SVM techniques in both binary and multi-class classifications. Simulation results show that the proposed basic ELM approach outperforms SVM in training and testing speed, while the proposed kernel based ELM achieves higher detection accuracy than SVM in multi-class classification case.

AB The original extreme learning machine (ELM), based on least square solutions, is an efficient learning algorithm used in "generalized" single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) which need not be neuron alike. Latest development [1] shows that ELM can be implemented with kernels. Kernlized ELM can be seen as a variant of the conventional LS-SVM without the output bias b. In this paper, the performance comparison of LS-SVM and kernelized ELM is conducted over a benchmarking face recognition dataset. Simulation results show that the kernelized ELM outperforms LS-SVM in terms of both recognition prediction accuracy and training speed.

AB The highly-interdisciplinary field of bioinformatics goal is to develop computing systems capable of analyzing molecular biology. We argue that bioinformatics has undergone a historical transition from the first phase to the second, now underway. The first phase was dominated by the use of traditional, intelligence-free computer programs such as database management systems, on the one hand, and by a small fraction of computational statistics, on the other hand. The second phase, now unfolding, heavily relies on artificial intelligence techniques such as probabilistic, nearest neighbor and genetic algorithm approaches, inter alia. In this first part of the present work, we describe both phases, emphasizing integration of alternative machine learning methods such as grammatical inference. This helps in constructing an overall framework including intelligent control described in the second part of the work, reported in an independent paper.

AB One of the key feature of modern architectures is deep memory hierarchies. In order to exploit this feature, one has to expose data locality with-in a program. Loop tiling is an optimization phase in modern compilers which is used to transform a loop for exposing data locality. Selecting the best tile size for a given architecture and compiler is known as Optimal Tile Size Selection Problem. It is a NP-hard problem. People have build cost models for this problem that characterize the performance of a program as a function of tile sizes. The best tile size for a given loop is determined directly by using these models. Hand crafting an accurate tile size selection cost model is hard. Can we automatically learn a tile size selection model? This is an importnat question. In this paper, we have shown that a fairly accurate model can be learned using simple program dynamic features with standard machine learning techniques. We evaluate our approach on different architecture and compiler combinations. The model given by us consistently shows near-optimal performance (within 4% of the optimal) across all architecture and compiler combinations.

AB The ensemble of online sequential extreme learning machine (EOS-ELM), an average of several online sequential extreme learning machines (OS-ELMs), can learn data one-by-one or chunk-by-chunk with fixed or varying chunk size. EOS-ELM provides higher accuracy with fewer training time, better generalization performance and stability than other popular sequential learning algorithms. However, in plenty of practical applications such as stock forecast, weather forecast, etc., training data often have timeliness, that is, each datum has a period of validity. In order to reflect the timeliness of training data in the process of learning, an improved EOS-ELM, called online sequential extreme learning machine with forgetting mechanism (FOS-ELM), is proposed in this paper. The proposed FOS-ELM cannot only retain the advantages of EOS-ELM, but also improve the learning effects by discarding the outdated data quickly in the process of learning to reduce their bad affection to the following learning. Detailed performance comparisons of FOS-ELM are carried out with EOS-ELM in the stock price short-term predictions. The experimental results show that FOS-ELM has higher accuracy with fewer training time, better stability and short-term predictability than EOS-ELM. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Language learning; machine translation; computer assisted language
   learning; second language acquisition
AB Free online machine translation (MT) such as provided by Google Translate, Bing Translator and Yahoo! Bablefish is now ubiquitous. Web users rely on it whenever they need to gain information from a language with which they are not familiar. So do second language learners-often enough as a shortcut to get their homework done, as a few language teachers have found. Should its use in the classroom context be penalised or can translation automation actually assist with students' learning?
   There is already a small body of research on the role of MT in language learning dating back to the nineties, but it was linked to a technology which was not as widespread, and addressed only the advanced language learner. New research is needed that takes into account recent developments and the most typical learner: the beginner.
   To initiate this research, the paper explores a group of teachers and learners' reactions towards the following five emerging translation automation technologies:
   1. Google Translate Conversation Mode. It combines MT with speech recognition and synthesis. Many students will have this application installed in their smart phone. Rather that supporting language learning one can imagine this doing away with its need: even at its current level of performance (and it's likely to improve with use) there is no need, for example, to learn basic Spanish to travel to South America any more.
   2. Duolingo (www. duolingo. com). The site aims at simultaneously helping to teach a language and to translate the web. It is not clear yet which use it will make of current MT if any, but assumes a model in which translations will be generated automatically from the guesses (and the votes) of the learners. Technology in this case will encourage rather than discourage language learning.
   3. Tradukka (www. tradukka. com). The site offers a user-friendly interface in which the language learner can compose into the language being learned from a draft written first in the mother tongue in one box, then translated by MT and finally proofread by the learner at another box on the side. The accuracy of the final output can be self-assessed via its back-translation into the mother tongue box.
   4. Gabble-on (www. gabbleon. com). The site started by asking volunteers to evaluate the performance of Google Translate, Bing Translator and Yahoo! Babelfish on small texts and ended up offering general language activities with a focus on maintaining what has been learnt.
   5. Microsoft's Contextual Thesaurus (http:// labs. microsofttranslator. com/ thesaurus). Is an English-toEnglish statistical MT system in which you can enter a phrase which generates (as statistical MT does) many paraphrases, some of which are likely to be acceptable and will constitute a thesaurus-like phrase book, more useful for language learning purposes that the typical word thesaurus since words carry meaning best when they are joined together.
   We will discuss teachers and students' views on whether translation automation will support or undermine language learning. In areas in which the consensus seems to be that it will support learning, we will look at the conditions under which the technology could become most effective.

AB We propose a distance phrase reordering model (DPR) for statistical machine translation (SMT), where the aim is to learn the grammatical rules and context dependent changes using a phrase reordering classification framework. We consider a variety of machine learning techniques, including state-of-the-art structured prediction methods. Techniques are compared and evaluated on a Chinese-English corpus, a language pair known for the high reordering characteristics which cannot be adequately captured with current models. In the reordering classification task, the method significantly outperforms the baseline against which it was tested, and further, when integrated as a component of the state-of-the-art machine translation system, MOSES, it achieves improvement in translation results.

AB We examine possibilities for making advances in nanocomputing by bringing in ideas from the field of machine learning. The potential from combining machine learning with nanocomputing seems to be underutilized. We review three complementary approaches. Firstly, machine learning can be used in the different phases of developing complicated nanocomputing devices: in modeling, designing, constructing, and programming the devices. Secondly, machine learning methods implemented by nanocomputing hardware can be a competitive solution especially for specialized application areas like sensory information processing; working towards such implementations advances nanocomputing by guiding development of the nanocomponents and architectures required for such applications. Thirdly, nanotechnology enabled quantum computing can significantly increase our capacity to solve NP-complete optimization problems; although this increase is not specific to machine learning, several such problems occur in machine learning and artificial intelligence, hence solving such problems is a useful goal that partly motivates development of quantum computing. The main value of this paper is to provide new ideas for researchers working on nanocomputing, nanoarchitectures, development and design of nanoprocessors and other nanocomponents, or nanomanufacturing.

ID DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
AB Pixel/voxel-based machine-learning techniques have been developed for classification between polyp regions of interest (ROIs) and non-polyp ROIs in computer-aided detection (CADe) of polyps in CT colonography (CTC). Although 2D/3D ROIs can be high-dimensional, they may reside in a lower dimensional manifold. We investigated the manifold structure of 2D CTC ROIs by use of the Laplacian eigenmaps technique. We compared a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the Laplacian eigenmaps-based dimensionality-reduced ROIs with massive-training support vector regression (MTSVR) in reduction of false positive (FP) detections. The Laplacian eigenmaps-based SVM classifier removed 16.0% (78/489) of FPs without any loss of polyps in a leave-one-lesion-out cross-validation test, whereas the MTSVR removed 49.9% (244/489); thus, yielded a 96.6% by-polyp sensitivity at an FP rate of 2.4 (254/106) per patient.

AB Credit risk evaluation has become an increasingly important field in financial risk management for financial institutions, especially for banks and credit card companies. Many data mining and statistical methods have been applied to this field. Extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier as a type of generalized single hidden layer feed-forward networks has been used in many applications and achieve good classification accuracy. Thus, we use ELM (kernel based) as a classification tool to perform the credit risk evaluation in this paper. The simulations are done on two credit risk evaluation datasets with three different kernel functions. Simulation results show that the kernel based ELM is more suitable for credit risk evaluation than the popular used Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with consideration of overall, good and bad accuracies.

AB We propose a few remedies to improve training of Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machines (GBRBM), which is known to be difficult. Firstly, we use a different parameterization of the energy function, which allows for more intuitive interpretation of the parameters and facilitates learning. Secondly, we propose parallel tempering learning for GBRBM. Lastly, we use an adaptive learning rate which is selected automatically in order to stabilize training. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed improvements indeed remove most of the difficulties encountered when training GBRBMs using conventional methods.

DE Bayesian; extreme learning machine; multilayer perceptron; radial basis
   function
AB The theory of extreme learning machine (ELM) has become very popular on the last few years. ELM is a new approach for learning the parameters of the hidden layers of a multilayer neural network (as the multilayer perceptron or the radial basis function neural network). Its main advantage is the lower computational cost, which is especially relevant when dealing with many patterns defined in a high-dimensional space. This brief proposes a Bayesian approach to ELM, which presents some advantages over other approaches: it allows the introduction of a priori knowledge; obtains the confidence intervals (CIs) without the need of applying methods that are computationally intensive, e.g., bootstrap; and presents high generalization capabilities. Bayesian ELM is benchmarked against classical ELM in several artificial and real datasets that are widely used for the evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Achieved results show that the proposed approach produces a competitive accuracy with some additional advantages, namely, automatic production of CIs, reduction of probability of model overfitting, and use of a priori knowledge.

AB The correct classification of sugar according to its physico-chemical characteristics directly influences the value of the product and its acceptance by the market. This study shows that using an electronic tongue system along with established techniques of supervised learning leads to the correct classification of sugar samples according to their qualities. In this paper, we offer two new real, public and non-encoded sugar datasets whose attributes were automatically collected using an electronic tongue, with and without pH controlling. Moreover, we compare the performance achieved by several established machine learning methods. Our experiments were diligently designed to ensure statistically sound results and they indicate that k-nearest neighbors method outperforms other evaluated classifiers and, hence, it can be used as a good baseline for further comparison.

AB Phospholipidosis is an adverse effect caused by numerous cationic amphiphilic drugs and can affect many cell types. It is characterized by the excess accumulation of phospholipids and is most reliably identified by electron microscopy of cells revealing the presence of lamellar inclusion bodies. The development of phospholipidosis can cause a delay in the drug development process, and the importance of computational approaches to the problem has been well documented. Previous work on predictive methods for phospholipidosis showed that state of the art machine learning methods produced the best results. Here we extend this work by looking at a larger data set mined from the literature. We find that circular fingerprints lead to better models than either E-Dragon descriptors or a combination of the two. We also observe very similar performance in general between Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models.

DE Feature reduction; ranking; machine learning
AB Feature reduction is a major problem in data mining. Though traditional methods such as feature ranking and subset selection have been widely used, there has been little consideration given to assuring satisfactory performance of a learning machine in relation to the minimum of features required or the "critical dimension". This critical dimension is unique to a specific dataset, learning machine, and ranking algorithm combination. The empirical methods demonstrate that many datasets show the existence of critical dimension. The dependence of this critical dimension on the learning machines and ranking algorithms could provide newer insights in understanding datasets, machine learning classifiers and ranking algorithms. The preliminary results of analysis show that the critical dimension depends largely on the feature ranking algorithm and that learning machines are less significant in determining the critical dimension.

AB Multiple Outlooks Learning (MOL) has recently received considerable attentions in machine learning. While traditional classification models often assume patterns are living in a fixed-dimensional vector space, MOL focuses on the tasks involving multiple representations or outlooks (e. g., biometrics based on face, fingerprint and iris); samples belonging to different outlooks may have varying feature dimensionalities and distributions. Current MOL methods attempted to first map each outlook heuristically to a common space, where samples from all the outlooks are assumed to share the same dimensionality and distribution after mapping. Traditional off-the-shelf classifiers can then be applied in the common space. The performance of these approaches is however often limited due to the independence of mapping functions learning and classifier learning. Different from existing approaches, in this paper, we proposed a novel MOL framework capable of learning jointly the mapping functions and the classifier in the common latent space. In particular, we coupled our novel framework with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and proposed a new model called MOL-SVM. MOL-SVM only needs to solve a sequence of standard linear SVM problems and converges rather rapidly within only a few steps. A series of experiments on the 20 newsgroups dataset demonstrated that our proposed model can consistently outperform the other competitive approaches.

AB Machine-learning algorithms pervade our daily lives. In epidemiology, supervised machine learning has the potential for classification, diagnosis and risk factor identification. Here, we report the use of support vector machine learning to identify the features associated with hock burn on commercial broiler farms, using routinely collected farm management data. These data lend themselves to analysis using machine-learning techniques. Hock burn, dermatitis of the skin over the hock, is an important indicator of broiler health and welfare. Remarkably, this classifier can predict the occurrence of high hock burn prevalence with accuracy of 0.78 on unseen data, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also compare the results with those obtained by standard multi-variable logistic regression and suggest that this technique provides new insights into the data. This novel application of a machine-learning algorithm, embedded in poultry management systems could offer significant improvements in broiler health and welfare worldwide.

AB We suggest a machine learning approach to classify English sentences as correct or incorrect. The basic idea is to investigate and compare several machine learning techniques to perform such a classification. For this paper, three machine learning tools that recognize syntactically correct English language sentences were used. The performances of the three tools - the C4.5 algorithm, Artificial Neural Network and the Lazy Clustering algorithm - are investigated with regard to a basic training set. The Lazy Clustering algorithm and the trained Artificial Neural Network were found to give a significantly higher result compared with C4.5 algorithm. Results also indicate that these two tools complement each other. This is an encouragement for further investigation to develop a hybrid solution to the problem.

AB Information is a powerful tool that can be used as a competitive advantage to increase market shares, competitiveness and keep products up-to-date. Protecting the information is a difficult task; intrusion detection systems is one of the tools of great importance for the protection of computer network infrastructures. IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems) are tools that help users and network administrators to keep safe from intruders and attacks of various natures. Machine learning techniques are one of the most popular techniques for IDSs proposed and investigated in the literature. This paper focuses on the use of ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) and OS-ELM (Online Sequential ELM) techniques applied to IDSs. Some features of these methods that motivate their use for building IDSs are: (i) easy assignment of parameters; (ii) good generalization; and (iii) fast and online training. The results show that the methods can be easily applied to a huge amount of data without a significant generalization loss.

AB In actual industrial fields, data for modelling are usually generated gradually, which requires that the data-based prediction model has the online learning capability. Although many online learning algorithms have been proposed, the generalization performance needs to be improved further. In this paper, a structure-adjustable online learning neural network (SAO-ELM) based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) with quicker learning speed and better generalization performance is proposed. Firstly, ELM is changed into a structure-adjustable learning machine, in which the number of nodes in its single hidden layer can be adjusted. Then, a special strategy is developed to handle the difficulty that the new added hidden nodes' outputs corresponding to the discarded training data cannot be obtained. After that, an iterative equation is presented to update the output matrix when hidden nodes are added. Results of numerical comparison based on data from the real world benchmark problems and an actual continuous casting process show that the performance of SAO-ELM has significant advantages over that of the typical online learning algorithms on generalization performance. In addition, SAO-ELM retains the merit of quick learning characteristic of ELM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The interest in the application of machine learning techniques (MLT) as drug design tools is growing in the last decades. The reason for this is related to the fact that the drug design is very complex and requires the use of hybrid techniques. A brief review of some MLT such as self-organizing maps, multilayer perceptron, bayesian neural networks, counter-propagation neural network and support vector machines is described in this paper. A comparison between the performance of the described methods and some classical statistical methods (such as partial least squares and multiple linear regression) shows that MLT have significant advantages. Nowadays, the number of studies in medicinal chemistry that employ these techniques has considerably increased, in particular the use of support vector machines. The state of the art and the future trends of MLT applications encompass the use of these techniques to construct more reliable QSAR models. The models obtained from MLT can be used in virtual screening studies as well as filters to develop/discovery new chemicals. An important challenge in the drug design field is the prediction of pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties, which can avoid failures in the clinical phases. Therefore, this review provides a critical point of view on the main MLT and shows their potential ability as a valuable tool in drug design.

AB As surveillance cameras become widespread, filters are needed to process large streams of image data and spot interesting events. Programmed image filters generally result in low to medium performing solutions. Data-derived filters perform better in that they tap on selected image features, but require a per-sensor effort by an analyst or a machine learning expert. This contribution addresses filter shaping as a data-driven process that is 'placed in the hands of many end-users' with extensive domain knowledge but no expertise in machine learning. The focus is on interactive machine learning technologies as a means to achieve self-programming and specialization of image filters that learn to search images by their content, sequential order, and temporal attributes. We describe and assess the performance of two interactive algorithms designed and implemented for a real case study in process monitoring for nuclear safeguards. Experiments show that interactive machine learning helps detect safeguards relevant event while significantly reducing the number of false positives.

DE restricted Boltzmann machine; classification; discriminative learning;

AB Recent developments have demonstrated the capacity of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to be powerful generative models, able to extract useful features from input data or construct deep artificial neural networks. In such settings, the RBM only yields a preprocessing or an initialization for some other model, instead of acting as a complete supervised model in its own right. In this paper, we argue that RBMs can provide a self-contained framework for developing competitive classifiers. We study the Classification RBM (ClassRBM), a variant on the RBM adapted to the classification setting. We study different strategies for training the ClassRBM and show that competitive classification performances can be reached when appropriately combining discriminative and generative training objectives. Since training according to the generative objective requires the computation of a generally intractable gradient, we also compare different approaches to estimating this gradient and address the issue of obtaining such a gradient for problems with very high dimensional inputs. Finally, we describe how to adapt the ClassRBM to two special cases of classification problems, namely semi-supervised and multitask learning.

AB We consider the task of suggesting related queries to users after they issue their initial query to a web search engine. We propose a machine learning approach to learn the probability that a user may find a follow-up query both useful and relevant, given his initial query. Our approach is based on a machine learning model which enables us to generalize to queries that have never occurred in the logs as well. The model is trained on co-occurrences mined from the search logs, with novel utility and relevance models, and the machine learning step is done without any labeled data by human judges. The learning step allows us to generalize from the past observations and generate query suggestions that are beyond the past co-occurred queries. This brings significant gains in coverage while yielding modest gains in relevance. Both offline (based on human judges) and online (based on millions of user interactions) evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines.

AB In this paper, we propose an improved learning algorithm named self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine (SaE-ELM) for single hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs). In SaE-ELM, the network hidden node parameters are optimized by the self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm, whose trial vector generation strategies and their associated control parameters are self-adapted in a strategy pool by learning from their previous experiences in generating promising solutions, and the network output weights are calculated using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse. SaE-ELM outperforms the evolutionary extreme learning machine (E-ELM) and the different evolutionary Levenberg-Marquardt method in general as it could self-adaptively determine the suitable control parameters and generation strategies involved in DE. Simulations have shown that SaE-ELM not only performs better than E-ELM with several manually choosing generation strategies and control parameters but also obtains better generalization performances than several related methods.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM), proposed by Huang et al., has been shown a promising learning algorithm for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). Nevertheless, because of the random choice of input weights and biases, the ELM algorithm sometimes makes the hidden layer output matrix H of SLFN not full column rank, which lowers the effectiveness of ELM. This paper discusses the effectiveness of ELM and proposes an improved algorithm called EELM that makes a proper selection of the input weights and bias before calculating the output weights, which ensures the full column rank of H in theory. This improves to some extend the learning rate (testing accuracy, prediction accuracy, learning time) and the robustness property of the networks. The experimental results based on both the benchmark function approximation and real-world problems including classification and regression applications show the good performances of EELM.

DE Dynamic HTML; Malicious webpage; Machine learning
AB The recent development of the dynamic HTML gives attackers a new and powerful technique to compromise computer systems. A Malicious dynamic HTML code is usually embedded in a normal webpage. The malicious webpage infects the victim when a user browses it. Furthermore such DHTML code can disguise itself easily through obfuscation or transformation, which makes the detection even harder. Anti-virus software packages commonly use signature-based approaches which might not be able to efficiently identify camouflaged malicious HTML codes. Therefore, our paper proposes a malicious web page detection using the technique of machine learning. Our study analyzes the characteristic of a malicious webpage systematically and presents important features for machine learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is resilient to code obfuscations and can correctly determine whether a webpage is malicious or not. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hence, the goal of this project is to reduce the encoding time while conserving the quality and compression ratio. Machine learning has been used to decide the mode decisions and hence reduce the motion estimation time. The proposed machine learning method on an average decreases the encoding time by 42.864% for mode decisions in H.264 encoder and .01% decrease in SSIM.

AB Data mining tasks are made more complicated when adversaries attack by modifying malicious data to evade detection. The main challenge lies in finding a robust learning model that is insensitive to unpredictable malicious data distribution. In this paper, we present a sparse relevance vector machine ensemble for adversarial learning. The novelty of our work is the use of individualized kernel parameters to model potential adversarial attacks during model training. We allow the kernel parameters to drift in the direction that minimizes the likelihood of the positive data. This step is interleaved with learning the weights and the weight priors of a relevance vector machine. Our empirical results demonstrate that an ensemble of such relevance vector machine models is more robust to adversarial attacks.

AB In this study we consider the single-machine scheduling problems with a sum of-processing- times-based learning effect. The sum of-processing-times-based learning effect of a job is assumed to be a function of the sum of the normal processing time of the already processed jobs. The objective is to minimize one of two regular objective functions, namely the weighted sum of completion times and the maximum lateness. We use the weighted shortest processing time (WSPT) rule and the earliest due date (EDD) rule as heuristics for the general cases and analyze their worst-case error bounds. We also provide computational results to evaluate the performance of the heuristics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Constructing a classifier that distinguishes machine translations from human translations is a promising approach to automatic evaluation of machine-translated sentences. Using this approach, we constructed a classifier using Support Vector Machines based on word-alignment distributions between source sentences and human or machine translations. This paper investigates the validity of the classification-based method by comparing it with well-known evaluation methods. The experimental results show that our classification-based method can accurately evaluate fluency of machine translations.

ID UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION; FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Functional data learning is an extension of traditional data learning, that is, learning the data chosen from the Euclidean space to a metric space. This paper focuses on the functional data learning with generalized single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (GSLFNs) acting on some metric spaces. In addition, three learning algorithms, named Hilbert parallel overrelaxation backpropagation (H-PORBP) algorithm, nu-generalized support vector regression (nu-GSVR) and generalized extreme learning machine (G-ELM) are proposed to train the GSLFNs acting on some metric spaces. The experimental results on some metric spaces indicate that GELM with additive/RBF hidden-nodes has a faster learning speed, a better accuracy, and a better stability than HPORBP algorithm and nu-GSVR for training the functional data. The idea of GELM can be used to extend those improved extreme learning machines (ELMs) that act on the Euclidean space such as online sequential ELM, incremental ELM, pruning ELM and so on, to some metric spaces.

TI Robust Optimization in Machine Learning

ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; REGULARIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; CONSISTENCY;
   REGRESSION; STABILITY; RECOVERY; NETWORKS
AB Robust optimization is a paradigm that uses ideas from convexity and duality to immunize solutions of convex problems against bounded uncertainty in the parameters of the problem. Machine learning is fundamentally about making decisions under uncertainty, and optimization has long been a central tool; thus, at a high level there is no surprise that robust optimization should have a role to play. Indeed, the first part of the story told in this chapter is about specializing robust optimization to specific optimization problems in machine learning. Yet, beyond this, there have been several surprising and deep developments in the use of robust optimization and machine learning, connecting consistency, generalization ability, and other properties (such as sparsity and stability) to robust optimization.
   In addition to surveying the direct applications of robust optimization to machine learning, important in their own right, this chapter explores some of these deeper connections, and points the way toward opportunities for applications and challenges for further research.

AB In this brief, the optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM) methodology is presented. It is based on the original extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm with additional steps to make it more robust and generic. The whole methodology is presented in detail and then applied to several regression and classification problems. Results for both computational time and accuracy (mean square error) are compared to the original ELM and to three other widely used methodologies: multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and Gaussian process (GP). As the experiments for both regression and classification illustrate, the proposed OP-ELM methodology performs several orders of magnitude faster than the other algorithms used in this brief, except the original ELM. Despite the simplicity and fast performance, the OP-ELM is still able to maintain an accuracy that is comparable to the performance of the SVM. A toolbox for the OP-ELM is publicly available online.

DE Active Learning; Named Entity Recognition; Support Vector Machine
AB One difficulty with machine learning for information extraction is the high cost of collecting labeled examples. Active Learning can make more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. In random sampling approach, unlabeled data is selected for annotation at random and thus can't yield the desired results. In contrast, active learning selects the useful data from a huge pool of unlabeled data for the classifier. The strategies used often classify the corpus tokens (or, data points) into wrong classes. The classifier is confused between two categories if the token is located near the margin. We propose a novel method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our approach is based on the supervised machine learning algorithm, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in two Indian languages, namely Hindi and Bengali. Results show that proposed active learning based technique indeed improves the performance of the system.

DE Scheduling; Single-machine; Learning effect
ID COMPLETION TIMES
AB In a manufacturing system workers are involved in doing the same job or activity repeatedly. Hence, the workers start learning more about the job or activity. Because of the learning, the time to complete the job or activity starts decreasing, which is known as "learning effect". In this paper, an exponential sum-of-actual-processing-time based learning effect is introduced into single-machine scheduling. By the exponential sum-of-actual-processing-time based learning effect, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by an exponential function of the sum-of-the-actual-processing-time of the already processed jobs. Under the proposed learning model, we show that under a sufficient condition, the makespan minimization problem, the sum of the 0th (0 > O) power of completion times minimization problem, and some special cases of the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem remain polynomially solvable.

AB The popularization of shared networks and Internet usage demands increases attention on information system security, particularly on intrusion detection, the traditional intrusion detection methods cannot work well with the more and more complicated intrusions. While accuracy is the essential requirement of an IDS, extensibility and adaptability are also critical in today's network computing environment. So introducing machine learning into intrusion detection systems to improve the performance has become one of the major concerns in the research of intrusion detection. This paper introduces the basic structure of the intrusion detection system and the application of machine learning in intrusion detection, including the Bayesian based method, the neural network based method, the data mining based method and the SVM based method.

AB The Laplacian support vector machine (LSVM) is a semi-supervised framework that uses manifold regularization for learning from labeled and unlabeled data. However, the optimal kernel parameters of LSVM are difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose a multi-kernel LSVM (MK-LSVM) method using multi-kernel learning formulations in combination with the LSVM. Our learning formulations assume that a set of base kernels are grouped, and employ l(2) norm regularization for automatically seeking the optimal linear combination of base kernels. Experimental testing reveals that our method achieves better performance than the LSVM alone using synthetic data, the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the Caltech database of Generic Object Classification.

AB For financial institutions, the ability to predict or forecast business failures is crucial, as incorrect decisions can have direct financial consequences. Bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring are the two major research problems in the accounting and finance domain. In the literature, a number of models have been developed to predict whether borrowers are in danger of bankruptcy and whether they should be considered a good or bad credit risk. Since the 1990s, machine-learning techniques, such as neural networks and decision trees, have been studied extensively as tools for bankruptcy prediction and credit score modeling. This paper reviews 130 related journal papers from the period between 1995 and 2010, focusing on the development of state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques, including hybrid and ensemble classifiers. Related studies are compared in terms of classifier design, datasets, baselines, and other experimental factors. This paper presents the current achievements and limitations associated with the development of bankruptcy-prediction and credit-scoring models employing machine learning. We also provide suggestions for future research.

AB In this paper we present experimental results of an automated method for image-based classification of diabetic retinopathy. The method is divided into three stages: image processing, feature extraction and image classification. In the first stage we have used two image processing techniques in order to enhance their features. Then, the second stage reduces the dimensionality of the images and finds features using the statistical method of principal component analysis. Finally, in the third stage the images are classified using machine learning algorithms, particularly, the naive Bayes classifier, neural networks, k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines. In our experimental study we classify two types of retinopathy: non-proliferative and proliferative. Preliminary results show that k-nearest neighbors obtained the best result with 68.7% using f-measure as metric, for a data set of 151 images with different resolutions.

AB Vasodilators have been extensively used in the treatment of various vascular diseases. With the aim of developing the accurate computational models for identifying vasodilators of diverse structures, several machine learning methods, such as C4.5 decision tree (C4.5 DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM), were explored in this work. These identification models were trained by using 198 three-dimensional molecular descriptors and a group of 635 compounds including 308 vasodilators and 327 non-vasodilators, in which feature selection was conducted to optimize the training models and select the most appropriate descriptors for identifying the vasodilators. An independent validation set of 74 vasodilators and 87 non-vasodilators was subsequently used to evaluate the performance of the developed identification models. The identification rates of these models are in the range of 78.38%-97.30% for vasodilators and 83.91%-86.21% for non-vasodilators. Our investigation reveals that the explored machine learning methods, especially SVM, are potentially useful for the identification of vasodilators. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Organization has come to realize that network security technology has become very important in protecting its information. With tremendous growth of internet, attack cases are increasing each day along with the modern attack method. One of the solutions to this problem is by using Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Machine Learning is one of the methods used in the IDS. In recent years, Machine Learning Intrusion Detection system has been giving high accuracy and good detection on novel attacks. In this paper the performance of a Machine Learning algorithm called Decision Tree (J48) is evaluated and compared with two other Machine Learning algorithms namely Neural Network and Support Vector Machines which has been conducted by A. Osareh [1] for detecting intrusion. The algorithms were tested based on accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate and accuracy of four categories of attacks. From the experiments conducted, it was found that the Decision tree (J48) algorithm outperformed the other two algorithms.

AB It is very important for financial institutions to develop credit rating systems to help them to decide whether to grant credit to consumers before issuing loans. In literature, statistical and machine learning techniques for credit rating have been extensively studied. Recent studies focusing on hybrid models by combining different machine learning techniques have shown promising results. However, there are various types of combination methods to develop hybrid models. It is unknown that which hybrid machine learning model can perform the best in credit rating. In this paper, four different types of hybrid models are compared by 'Classification + Classification', 'Classification + Clustering', 'Clustering + Classification', and 'Clustering + Clustering' techniques, respectively. A real world dataset from a bank in Taiwan is considered for the experiment. The experimental results show that the 'Classification + Classification' hybrid model based on the combination of logistic regression and neural networks can provide the highest prediction accuracy and maximize the profit.

AB Whenever the quality provided by a machine translation system is not enough, a human expert is required to correct the sentences provided by the machine translation system. In this environment, the human translator is generating bilingual data after each translation has been marked as correct, and expects the system to be able to learn from the errors made. In this paper, we analyse the appropriateness of discriminative ridge regression for adapting the scaling factors of a state-of-the-art machine translation system within a conventional post-editing scenario and also within an interactive machine translation setup. Results show that the strategies applied in the former setup cannot be directly applied in the latter framework. Hence, the discriminative ridge regression is revised and adapted for the interactive machine translation framework, with encouraging results.

Its limits lie on no comprehension and no memory, and no dynamic correlation. In the new method, it can learn from dynamic examples, the change of data can be learned because the training data is the initial and end process in the interval. All varieties and correlation can be understood and remembered. By experiments, the method can be used as classifier and it has special use in the field of information mining.

These techniques are now used extensively at various phases during the drug development process. Such tools perform a wide range of functions from retrieving and analyzing data to sophisticated computational models for many biological and chemical processes in drug discovery. Among them, machine-learning techniques are becoming especially popular because of their emphasis on obtaining accurate predictions. In this overview, we discuss the increasing role of Machine Learning in Drug Discovery. Since this field has close connections with the field of Statistics, we will first describe similarities and differences between these fields. We will then highlight various domains and problems within drug discovery that are utilizing machine-learning technology to improve and speed up the drug discovery process.

AB Traditional whole building energy modeling suffers from several factors, including the large number of inputs required for building characterization, simplifying assumptions, and the gap between the as-designed and as-built building. Prior work has attempted to mitigate these problems by using sensor-based machine learning approaches to statistically model energy consumption, applying the techniques primarily to commercial building data, which makes use of hourly consumption data. It is unclear, however, whether these techniques can translate to residential buildings, since the energy usage patterns may vary significantly. Until now, most residential modeling research only had access to monthly electrical consumption data. In this article, we report on the evaluation of seven different machine learning algorithms applied to a new residential data set that contains sensor measurements collected every 15 min, with the objective of determining which techniques are most successful for predicting next hour residential building consumption. We first validate each learner's correctness on the ASHRAE Great Energy Prediction Shootout, confirming existing conclusions that Neural Network-based methods perform best on commercial buildings. However, our additional results show that these methods perform poorly on residential data, and that Least Squares Support Vector Machines perform best - a technique not previously applied to this domain.

AB Machine learning algorithms in various forms are now increasingly being used on a variety of portable devices, starting from cell phones to PDAs. They often form a part of standard applications (e.g. for grammar-checking in email clients) that run on these devices and occupy a significant fraction of processor and memory bandwidth. However, most of the research within the machine learning community has ignored issues like memory usage and power consumption of processors running these algorithms. In this paper we investigate how machine learned models can be developed in a power-aware manner for deployment on resource-constrained portable devices. We show that by tolerating a small loss in accuracy, it is possible to dramatically improve the energy consumption and data cache behavior of these algorithms. More specifically, we explore a typical sequential labeling problem of part-of-speech tagging in natural language processing and show that a power-aware design can achieve up to 50% reduction in power consumption, trading off a minimal decrease in tagging accuracy of 3%.

AB Visual inspection on the surface of components is a main application of machine vision. Visual inspection finds its application in identifying defects such as scratches, cracks bubbles and measurement of cutting tool wear and welding quality. Machine learning approach to machine vision helps in automating the design process of machine vision systems. This approach involves image acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. Study shows a library of features, and classifiers are available to classify the data. However, only the best combination of them can yield the highest classification accuracy. In this study, images with different known conditions were acquired, preprocessed, and histogram features were extracted. The classification accuracies of C4.5 classifier algorithm and Naive Bayes algorithm were compared, and results are reported. The study shows that C4.5 algorithm performs better.

AB This paper presents work on using machine learning approaches for analyzing triathlon components for talent identification and predicting performance patterns of medalists. Triathlon is a high profile multi-component sport which requires strategic understanding and planning with respect to each of the three sports: swimming, cycling, and running, to achieve the best overall standing. We carried out machine learning decision tree-based analysis and probabilistic modeling on triathlon historical data since 1989 to investigate what minimum time gap behind the lead athlete (for each event) still results in a high likelihood of medaling. We found the minimum time differentials from the leader in each event, as well as the overall differential time that still results in a large chance of medal winning.

AB Machine learning is an established method of selecting algorithms to solve hard search problems. Despite this, to date no systematic comparison and evaluation of the different techniques has been performed and the performance of existing systems has not been critically compared with other approaches. We compare the performance of a large number of different machine learning techniques from different machine learning methodologies on five data sets of hard algorithm selection problems from the literature. In addition to well-established approaches, for the first time we also apply statistical relational learning to this problem. We demonstrate that there is significant scope for improvement both compared with existing systems and in general. To guide practitioners, we close by giving clear recommendations as to which machine learning techniques are likely to achieve good performance in the context of algorithm selection problems. In particular, we show that linear regression and alternating decision trees have a very high probability of achieving better performance than always selecting the single best algorithm.

AB The purpose of this article is to present the application of the A-team approach to solving some machine learning problems belonging to the supervised and unsupervised learning classes. Because the above problems are computationally hard, it is proposed to take advantage of the robustness and flexibility of population-based methods combined with the efficiency of multi-agent systems integrated within the A-team concept. The main part of the article summarizes the experiences of the authors gained while developing various A-teams and includes some examples of population-based multi-agent algorithms for solving problems from the machine learning domain. It can be concluded that population-based multi-agent algorithms can be competitive in comparison with other existing techniques for some machine learning problems.

AB We review the current state of data mining and machine learning in astronomy. Data Mining can have a somewhat mixed connotation from the point of view of a researcher in this field. If used correctly, it can be a powerful approach, holding the potential to fully exploit the exponentially increasing amount of available data, promising great scientific advance. However, if misused, it can be little more than the black box application of complex computing algorithms that may give little physical insight, and provide questionable results. Here, we give an overview of the entire data mining process, from data collection through to the interpretation of results. We cover common machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines, applications from a broad range of astronomy, emphasizing those in which data mining techniques directly contributed to improving science, and important current and future directions, including probability density functions, parallel algorithms, Peta-Scale computing, and the time domain. We conclude that, so long as one carefully selects an appropriate algorithm and is guided by the astronomical problem at hand, data mining can be very much the powerful tool, and not the questionable black box.

AB Teaching performance evaluation can be done using multiple sources, like students, peers and teachers themselves. Even though only peers have the substantive expertise for a relevant evaluation, it is generally well-known that students are qualified to assess some of the classroom teaching aspects: clarity of the presentation, interpersonal rapport with students etc. The core idea of this research is to study if there can be built a computational model that uses past students evaluation in order to predict future teaching performance assessments. There can be designed different system based on supervised machine learning techniques. In this paper there are built several models based on two classification techniques: K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine with the purpose of finding a model that has the smaller classification error of the new cases.

The well known theory of user modeling is used to collect user characteristics and as second step a classical machine learning approach is incorporated in order to intelligently use these characteristics to create student groups. The resulting student groups promote win-win collaboration, thus support the learning process and provide additional educational benefits for the learners.

AB Teaching quality is a key metric in college teaching effect and ability evaluation. In many previous literatures, evaluation of such metric is merely depended on subjective judgment of few experts based on their experience, which leads to some false, bias or unstable results. Moreover, pure human based evaluation is expensive that is difficult to extend to large scale. With the application of information technology, much information in college teaching is recorded and stored electronically, which founds the basic of a computer-aid analysis. In this paper, we perform teaching quality evaluation within machine learning framework, focusing on learning and modeling electronic information associated with quality of teaching, to get a stable model described the substantial principles of teaching quality. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is selected as the main model in this work. Experiment results on real data sets consisted of 4 subjects / 8 semesters show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Kernel machines have gained much popularity in applications of machine learning. Support vector machines (SVMs) are a subset of kernel machines and generalize well for classification, regression, and anomaly detection tasks. The training procedure for traditional SVMs involves solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem. The QP problem scales super linearly in computational effort with the number of training samples and is often used for the offline batch processing of data. Kernel machines operate by retaining a subset of observed data during training. The data vectors contained within this subset are referred to as support vectors (SVs). The work presented in this paper introduces a subset selection method for the use of kernel machines in online, changing environments. Our algorithm works by using a stochastic indexing technique when selecting a subset of SVs when computing the kernel expansion. The work described here is novel because it separates the selection of kernel basis functions from the training algorithm used. The subset selection algorithm presented here can be used in conjunction with any online training technique. It is important for online kernel machines to be computationally efficient due to the real-time requirements of online environments. Our algorithm is an important contribution because it scales linearly with the number of training samples and is compatible with current training techniques. Our algorithm outperforms standard techniques in terms of computational efficiency and provides increased recognition accuracy in our experiments. We provide results from experiments using both simulated and real-world data sets to verify our algorithm.

AB Data discretization is an important processing step for several computational methods that work only with binary input data. In this work a method for discretize continuous data based on the use of the Extreme Learning Machine neural network architecture is developed and tested. The new method does not use data labels for performing the discretization process and thus is suitable for supervised and supervised data and also, as it is based on the Extreme Learning Machine, is very fast even for large input data sets. The efficiency of the new method is analyzed on several benchmark functions, testing the classification accuracy obtained with raw and discretized data, and also in comparison to results from the application of a state-of-the-art supervised discretization algorithm. The results indicate the suitability of the developed approach.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an efficient learning algorithm for generalized single hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), which performs well in both regression and classification applications. It has recently been shown that from the optimization point of view ELM and support vector machine (SVM) are equivalent but ELM has less stringent optimization constraints. Due to the mild optimization constraints ELM can be easy of implementation and usually obtains better generalization performance. In this paper we study the performance of the one-against-all (OAA) and one-against-one (OAO) ELM for classification in multi-label face recognition applications. The performance is verified through four benchmarking face image data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pollen is among the most ubiquitous of terrestrial fossils, preserving an extended record of vegetation change. However, this temporal continuity comes with a taxonomic tradeoff. Analytical methods that improve the taxonomic precision of pollen identifications would expand the research questions that could be addressed by pollen, in fields such as paleoecology, paleoclimatology, biostratigraphy, melissopalynology, and forensics. We developed a supervised, layered, instance-based machine-learning classification system that uses leave-one-out bias optimization and discriminates among small variations in pollen shape, size, and texture. We tested our system on black and white spruce, two paleoclimatically significant taxa in the North American Quaternary. We achieved > 93% grain-to-grain classification accuracies in a series of experiments with both fossil and reference material. More significantly, when applied to Quaternary samples, the learning system was able to replicate the count proportions of a human expert (R-2 = 0.78, P = 0.007), with one key difference the machine achieved these ratios by including larger numbers of grains with low-confidence identifications. Our results demonstrate the capability of machine-learning systems to solve the most challenging palynological classification problem, the discrimination of congeneric species, extending the capabilities of the pollen analyst and improving the taxonomic resolution of the palynological record.

AB Users of Digital libraries require more intelligent interaction functionality to satisfy their needs. In this perspective, the most important features are flexibility and capability of adapting these functionalities to specific users. However, the main problem of current systems is their inability to support different needs of individual users due both to their inability to identify those needs, and, more importantly, to insufficient mapping of those needs to the available resources/services. The approaches considered in this paper to tackle such problems concern the use of Machine Learning techniques to adapt the set of user stereotypes with the aim of modelling user interests and behaviour in order to provide the most suitable service. A purposely designed simulation scenario was exploited to show the applicability of the proposal.

AB Faced to continuous arising new threats, the detection of anomalies in current operational networks has become essential. Network operators have to deal with huge data volumes for analysis purpose. To counter this main issue, dealing with IP flow (also known as Netflow) records is common in network management. However, still in modern networks, Netflow records represent high volume of data. In this paper, we present an approach for evaluating Netflow records by referring to a method of temporal aggregation applied to Machine Learning techniques. We present an approach that leverages support vector machines in order to analyze large volumes of Netflow records. Our approach is using a special kernel function, that takes into account both the contextual and the quantitative information of Netflow records. We assess the viability of our method by practical experimentation on data volumes provided by a major internet service provider in Luxembourg.

AB We apply machine-learning techniques to construct nonlinear nonparametric forecasting models of consumer credit risk. By combining customer transactions and credit bureau data from January 2005 to April 2009 for a sample of a major commercial bank's customers, we are able to construct out-of-sample forecasts that significantly improve the classification rates of credit-card-holder delinquencies and defaults, with linear regression R-2's of forecasted/realized delinquencies of 85%. Using conservative assumptions for the costs and benefits of cutting credit lines based on machine-learning forecasts, we estimate the cost savings to range from 6% to 25% of total losses. Moreover, the time-series patterns of estimated delinquency rates from this model over the course of the recent financial crisis suggest that aggregated consumer credit-risk analytics may have important applications in forecasting systemic risk.

Working in groups has been promoted, as well as problem solving and self-learning exercises, all of which are evaluated in a way that encourages students' participation. Finally, the students' learning process in the lab has been improved by the development both of a new methodology to follow in the lab and new workbenches with industrial machines that are easier to use and also enable the lab experiments to be automated. Finally, the first results obtained as a result of applying the proposed methodology are presented.

Various learning algorithms have been developed to achieve autonomous operation and intelligent decision making for many complex and challenging control problems. One of such problems is bipedal walking robot control. Although still in their early stages, learning techniques have demonstrated promising potential to build adaptive control systems for bipedal robots. This paper gives a review of recent advances on the state-of-the-art learning algorithms and their applications to bipedal robot control. The effects and limitations of different learning techniques are discussed through a representative selection of examples from the literature.

AB In this paper, we consider a single machine scheduling problem with a learning effect and discounted costs. The learning effect of a job is assumed to be a function of its position. We show that discounted total completion time is minimized by the classical shortest processing time first (SPT) rule. For the following objective function, discounted total weighted completion time, we show by an example that the optimal schedule of the classical discounted weighted shortest processing time first (WDSPT) rule is not optimal in the presence of a learning effect. But for some special cases, we prove that the WDSPT rule can construct the optimal sequence. We give the worst-case error bound for the WDSPT rule in the general case. Some extensions of the problem are also given.

AB In this paper, we present a framework which enables medical decision making in the presence of partial information. At its core is ontology-based automated reasoning; machine learning techniques are integrated to enhance existing patient datasets in order to address the issue of missing data. Our approach supports interoperability between different health information systems. This is clarified in a sample implementation that combines three separate datasets (patient data, drug-drug interactions and drug prescription rules) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in producing effective medical decisions. In short, we demonstrate the potential for machine learning to support a task where there is a critical need from medical professionals by coping with missing or noisy patient data and enabling the use of multiple medical datasets.

Under this framework, we investigated possible equivalence relations, data dependencies, rule generation, rule stability, question-answering systems, as well as missing and interval values as special cases of non-deterministic values. In this paper, we briefly survey RNIA, and report the state of its underlying software implementation. We also discuss to what extent RNIA can be seen as an example of a new emerging paradigm in machine learning.

AB This paper addresses the recent trends in machine learning methods for the automatic classification of remote sensing (RS) images. In particular, we focus on two new paradigms: semisupervised and active learning. These two paradigms allow one to address classification problems in the critical conditions where the available labeled training samples are limited. These operational conditions are very usual in RS problems, due to the high cost and time associated with the collection of labeled samples. Semisupervised and active learning techniques allow one to enrich the initial training set information and to improve classification accuracy by exploiting unlabeled samples or requiring additional labeling phases from the user, respectively. The two aforementioned strategies are theoretically and experimentally analyzed considering SVM-based techniques in order to highlight advantages and disadvantages of both strategies.

DE authorship identification; machine learning; similarity ranking
AB In the authorship identification task, examples of short writings of N authors and an anonymous document written by one of these N authors are given. The task is to determine the authorship of the anonymous text. Practically all approaches solved this problem with machine learning methods. The input attributes for the machine learning process are usually formed by stylistic or grammatical properties of individual documents or a defined similarity between a document and an author. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment to extend the machine learning attributes by ranking the similarity between a document and an author: we transform the similarity between an unknown document and one of the N authors to the order in which the author is the most similar to the document in the set of N authors. The comparison of similarity probability and similarity ranking was made using the Support Vector Machines algorithm. The results show that machine learning methods perform slightly better with attributes based on the ranking of similarity than with previously used similarity between an author and a document.

AB Background: Electronic health record (EHR) databases contain vast amounts of information about patients. Machine learning techniques such as Boosting and support vector machine (SVM) can potentially identify patients at high risk for serious conditions, such as heart disease, from EHR data. However, these techniques have not yet been widely tested.
   Objective: To model detection of heart failure more than 6 months before the actual date of clinical diagnosis using machine learning techniques applied to EHR data. To compare the performance of logistic regression, SVM, and Boosting, along with various variable selection methods in heart failure prediction.
   Research Design: Geisinger Clinic primary care patients with data in the EHR data from 2001 to 2006 diagnosed with heart failure between 2003 and 2006 were identified. Controls were randomly selected matched on sex, age, and clinic for this nested case-control study.
   Measures: Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operator characteristic curve was computed for each method using 10-fold cross-validation. The number of variables selected by each method was compared.
   Results: Logistic regression with model selection based on Bayesian information criterion provided the most parsimonious model, with about 10 variables selected on average, while maintaining a high AUC (0.77 in 10-fold cross-validation). Boosting with strict variable importance threshold provided similar performance.
   Conclusions: Heart failure was predicted more than 6 months before clinical diagnosis, with AUC of about 0.76, using logistic regression and Boosting. These results were achieved even with strict model selection criteria. SVM had the poorest performance, possibly because of imbalanced data.

DE Classification; support vector machine; metric learning; kernel function
AB This paper introduces a novel classification approach which improves the performance of support vector machines (SVMs) by learning a distance metric. The metric learned is a Mahalanobis metric previously trained so that examples from different classes are separated with a large margin. The learned metric is used to define a kernel function for SVM classification. In this context, the metric can be seen as a linear transformation of the original inputs before applying an SVM classifier that uses Euclidean distances. This transformation increases the separability of classes in the transformed space where the classification is applied. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks on various data sets.

ID MUTATION
AB Machine learning algorithms have provided core functionality to many application domains - such as bioinformatics, computational linguistics, etc. However, it is difficult to detect faults in such applications because often there is no "test oracle" to verify the correctness of the computed outputs. To help address the software quality, in this paper we present a technique for testing the implementations of machine learning classification algorithms which support such applications. Our approach is based on the technique "metamorphic testing", which has been shown to be effective to alleviate the oracle problem. Also presented include a case study on a real-world machine learning application framework, and a discussion of how programmers implementing machine learning algorithms can avoid the common pitfalls discovered in our study. We also conduct mutation analysis and cross-validation, which reveal that our method has high effectiveness in killing mutants, and that observing expected cross-validation result alone is not sufficiently effective to detect faults in a supervised classification program. The effectiveness of metamorphic testing is further confirmed by the detection of real faults in a popular open-source classification program. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Voting machines are widely used in the classroom to improve the communication between the lecturer and students. They allow lecturers to get precise real-time feedback and evaluate students' responses to concept tests statistically. With these systems, students can learn concepts at the beginning/end and during the lecture. In this research, a method was developed and used with voting machines in large lecture physics classrooms. The method was tested by comparing student performance in voting machine and non-voting machine lecture sections during consecutive three semesters in introductory calculus-based physics I course. Data from the Force Concept Inventory and common examination questions indicates that students using voting machines achieved a significant gain in conceptual learning, and that voting machines reduced the gap between male and female student performances on tests. The results showed that students were positive about the use of voting machines and believed that they helped them learn.

DT Article
DE Active learning; Concept learning; Inconsistency; Sample selection;

ID IMAGE RETRIEVAL; QUERY
AB In classification tasks, active learning is often used to select out a set of informative examples from a big unlabeled dataset. The objective is to learn a classification pattern that can accurately predict labels of new examples by using the selection result which is expected to contain as few examples as possible. The selection of informative examples also reduces the manual effort for labeling, data complexity, and data redundancy, thus improves learning efficiency. In this paper, a new active learning strategy with pool-based settings, called inconsistency-based active learning, is proposed. This strategy is built up under the guidance of two classical works: (1) the learning philosophy of query-by-committee (QBC) algorithm; and (2) the structure of the traditional concept learning model: from-general-to-specific (GS) ordering. By constructing two extreme hypotheses of the current version space, the strategy evaluates unlabeled examples by a new sample selection criterion as inconsistency value, and the whole learning process could be implemented without any additional knowledge. Besides, since active learning is favorably applied to support vector machine (SVM) and its related applications, the strategy is further restricted to a specific algorithm called inconsistency-based active learning for SVM (I-ALSVM). By building up a GS structure, the sample selection process in our strategy is formed by searching through the initial version space. We compare the proposed I-ALSVM with several other pool-based methods for SVM on selected datasets. The experimental result shows that, in terms of generalization capability, our model exhibits good feasibility and competitiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper deals with the recognition of handwritten Malayalam character using wavelet energy feature (WEF) and extreme learning machine (ELM). The wavelet energy (WE) is a new and robust parameter, and is derived using wavelet transform. It can reduce the influences of different types of noise at different levels. WEF can reflect the WE distribution of characters in several directions at different scales. To a non oscillating pattern, the amplitudes of wavelet coefficients increase when the scale of wavelet decomposition increase. WE of different decomposition levels have different powers to discriminate the character images. These features constitute patterns of handwritten characters for classification. The traditional learning algorithms of the different classifiers are far slower than required. So we have used an extremely fast leaning algorithm called ELM for single hidden layer feed forward networks (SLFN), which randomly chooses the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of SLFN. This algorithm learns much faster than traditional popular learning algorithms for feed forward neural networks. This feature vector, classifier combination gave good recognition accuracy at level 6 of the wavelet decomposition.

By the effects of learning and deterioration, we mean that job processing times are defined by functions of their starting times and positions in the sequence. It is shown that even with the introduction of learning effect and deteriorating jobs to job processing times, single-machine makespan minimization problem and the sum of the 0th power of job completion times minimization problem remain polynomially solvable, respectively. But for the following objective functions: the weighted sum of completion times and the maximum lateness, this paper proves that the WWPT rule and the EDD rule can construct the optimal sequence under some special cases, respectively.

AB The ability to accurately classify targets is critical to the performance of automated/assisted target recognition (ATR) algorithms. Supervised machine learning methods have been shown to be able to classify data in a variety of disciplines with a high level of accuracy. The performance of machine learning techniques in classifying ground targets in two-dimensional radar imagery were compared. Three machine learning models were compared to determine which model best classifies targets with the highest accuracy: decision tree, Bayes', and support vector machine. X-band signature data acquired in scale-model compact ranges were used. ISAR images were compared using several techniques including two-dimensional cross-correlation and pixel by pixel comparison of the image against a reference image. The highly controlled nature of the collected imagery was ideally suited for the inter-comparison of the machine learning models. The resulting data from the image comparisons were used as the feature space for testing the accuracy of the three types of classifiers. Classifier accuracy was determined using N-fold cross-validation.

Through introducing multiple kernel learning into the SVM incremental learning, large scale data set learning problem can be solved effectively. Furthermore, different punishments are adopted in allusion to the training subset and the acquired support vectors, which may help to improve the performance of SVM. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can not only solve the model selection problem in SVM incremental learning, but also improve the classification or prediction precision.

AB In this paper, a real-time watermarking scheme based on Regularized Extreme Learning Machine (RELM) is proposed. Using the information provided by the reference positions, RELM can be trained at the embedding procedure and watermark is adaptively embedded into the blue channel of the original image by considering the human visual system. Due to the extreme training speed (always hundreds of times faster than BP neural network and Support Vector Machine (SVM)) and good generalized performance, the trained RELM can exactly extract the watermark from the watermarked image against image processing attacks within very short time, and this makes this method applicable in real-time environment. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our technique outperforms Kutter's and Yu's method against simple and multiple attacks.

DE Mammogram segmentation; extreme learning machine
ID MASS
AB Digital mammography is a preferred method for early detection of breast cancer. However, in most cases, it is very difficult to distinguish benign and malignant masses without a biopsy, hence, misdiagnosis is always possible. In this paper, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm is used to classify the suspicious masses in digitized mammograms available in the Mini-MIAS database. As selection of features is critical in efficient classification of mammograms, a study was conducted to identify the best features that make a clear distinction between the malignant and benign masses. Then, the recently developed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based classifier is used to classify the benign and malignant cases. It is observed that the performance of the batch learning ELM algorithm is dependent on the number of hidden neurons, and the magnitude of input weight initialization. An extensive study is conducted to identify the best number of neurons to achieve the best training and testing classification performance. The performance results are then compared with the classification results, available in the literature. The performance study results show that the classification efficiency of the ELM classifier is better than the other existing algorithms, for the mammogram classification problem of the database considered for this study.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a new learning algorithm for single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) proposed by Huang et al. [1]. Its main advantage is the lower computational cost, which is especially relevant when dealing with many patterns defined in a high-dimensional space. This paper proposes an algorithm for pruning ELM networks by using regularized regression methods, thus obtaining a suitable number of the hidden nodes in the network architecture. Beginning from an initial large number of hidden nodes, irrelevant nodes are then pruned using ridge regression, elastic net and lasso methods; hence, the architectural design of ELM network can be automated. Empirical studies on several commonly used regression benchmark problems show that the proposed approach leads to compact networks that generate competitive results compared with the ELM algorithm.

AB Extracting useful temporal and spatial patterns from sensor data has been seen before, the technical basis of Machine learning with Data mining is studied with the evidence collected uniformly over many years and which allow using users' perspective in collected evidence. This model helps in probabilistically forecasting fires and help forest department in planing day to day schedules. Using a model to predict future events reliably one needs to collect samples from sensors and select a feature, which does have any particular bias. Due to practicable problems most of the collected data have 80% of attributes missing and the remaining has numeric values, which are hard to discretization. To adapt to such limitations, we use nominal data type, which allows better understanding of the temporal and spatial features, which are learnt. We encounter several practicable limitations as forest fires events are very rare and manual classification is extremely costly. Another is the unbalanced nature of the problem of the many forest fire events many are of the burnt area is very small and gives skewed distribution. Most of the examples naturally group into batches, which are collected from evidence satellite photography and collaborative reports from national parks departments. The second set of database was collected from the meteorological weather station about several weather observations, which are located very close to the reported fires. Finally, the compiling task is to serve as a filter and provide the user to vary the false alarm rate. We show by regression analysis of the compiled dataset that the forest fire classifier has a minimum false alarm rate when including temporal features. The machine learning algorithms successfully classifies accidental small fires with 85% reliably and large fires by a much lower accuracy of 30%.

ID NETWORKS; ONLINE; APPROXIMATION; CLASSIFIERS; SIZE
AB Due to the simplicity of their implementations, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and proximal support vector machine (PSVM) have been widely used in binary classification applications. The conventional LS-SVM and PSVM cannot be used in regression and multiclass classification applications directly, although variants of LS-SVM and PSVM have been proposed to handle such cases. This paper shows that both LS-SVM and PSVM can be simplified further and a unified learning framework of LS-SVM, PSVM, and other regularization algorithms referred to extreme learning machine (ELM) can be built. ELM works for the "generalized" single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping) in ELM need not be tuned. Such SLFNs include but are not limited to SVM, polynomial network, and the conventional feedforward neural networks. This paper shows the following: 1) ELM provides a unified learning platform with a widespread type of feature mappings and can be applied in regression and multiclass classification applications directly; 2) from the optimization method point of view, ELM has milder optimization constraints compared to LS-SVM and PSVM; 3) in theory, compared to ELM, LS-SVM and PSVM achieve suboptimal solutions and require higher computational complexity; and 4) in theory, ELM can approximate any target continuous function and classify any disjoint regions. As verified by the simulation results, ELM tends to have better scalability and achieve similar (for regression and binary class cases) or much better (for multiclass cases) generalization performance at much faster learning speed (up to thousands times) than traditional SVM and LS-SVM.

AB Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been widely deployed in organizations nowadays as the last defense for the network security. However, one of the big problems of these systems is that a large amount of alarms especially false alarms will be produced during the detection process, which greatly aggravates the analysis workload and reduces the effectiveness of detection. To mitigate this problem, we advocate that the construction of a false alarm filter by utilizing machine learning schemes is an effective solution. In this paper, we propose an adaptive false alarm filter aiming to filter out false alarms with the best machine learning algorithm based on distinct network contexts. In particular, we first compare with six specific machine learning schemes to illustrate their unstable performance. Then, we demonstrate the architecture of our adaptive false alarm filter. The evaluation results show that our approach is effective and encouraging in real scenarios.

AB With the growing adoption of virtualized datacenters and cloud hosting services, the allocation and sizing of resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O bandwidth for virtual machines (VMs) is becoming increasingly important. Accurate performance modeling of an application would help users in better VM sizing, thus reducing costs. It can also benefit cloud service providers who can offer a new charging model based on the VMs' performance instead of their configured sizes.
   In this paper, we present techniques to model the performance of a VM-hosted application as a function of the resources allocated to the VM and the resource contention it experiences. To address this multi-dimensional modeling problem, we propose and refine the use of two machine learning techniques: artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). We evaluate these modeling techniques using five virtualized applications from the RUBiS and Filebench suite of benchmarks and demonstrate that their median and 90th percentile prediction errors are within 4.36% and 29.17% respectively. These results are substantially better than regression based approaches as well as direct applications of machine learning techniques without our refinements. We also present a simple and effective approach to VM sizing and empirically demonstrate that it can deliver optimal results for 65% of the sizing problems that we studied and produces close-to-optimal sizes for the remaining 35%.

AB Aiming to the fact that it is still difficult to reasonably forecasting the karstic collapse, the model based on GP machine learning is proposed for forecasting of karstic collapse. According to few learning samples, the nonlinear mapping relationship between karstic collapse and its influencing factors is established by GP model. The model was applied to a real engineering.

AB Aiming to the fact that it is still difficult to reasonably forecasting the karstic collapse, the model based on GP machine learning is proposed for forecasting of karstic collapse. According to few learning samples, the nonlinear mapping relationship between karstic collapse and its influencing factors is established by GP model. The model was applied to a real engineering. The results of case study show that GP model is feasible, effective and simple to implement for forecasting of karstic collapse. Compared with artificial neural networks and support vector machine, it has attractive merits of self-adaptive parameters determination and excellent capacity for solving nonlinear small samples problems.

AB In this paper, we show that the main results in a recent paper by Zhang and Yan [X. Zhang and G. Yan, Machine scheduling problems with a general learning effect. Mathematical and Computer Modelling 51(2010)84-90] are incorrect as an important reason is missing, that is, the processing time of a job is variable according to a general learning effect. Here we point out these wrong results by a counter-example. In addition, we give a revised model with a general learning effect. We show that some single machine scheduling problems are still polynomially solvable under the revised model. We also show that some special cases of the flowshop scheduling problems can be solved in polynomial time under the revised model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a new approach to improving the overall aeroacoustic comfort of a vehicle, an important feature of vehicle design. The traditional improvement process is extended to benefit extensively from machine learning, information retrieval and information extraction technologies to assist the wind tunnel engineers with difficult tasks. The paper first describes the general approach and then focuses on providing a detailed description of the most important task of assessing the degree of discomfort for a human caused by wind noise in a vehicle, when the noise spectrum is known. For this purpose a novel approach of learning linear regression models that are consistent with expert's domain knowledge is presented. The results of the end user evaluation of the entire system are also presented to reflect the strengths of this approach. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Automated classification of granite slabs is a key aspect of the automation of processes in the granite transformation sector. This classification task is currently performed manually on the basis of the subjective opinions of an expert in regard to texture and colour. We describe a classification method based on machine learning techniques fed with spectral information for the rock, supplied in the form of discrete values captured by a suitably parameterized spectrophotometer. The machine learning techniques applied in our research take a functional perspective, with the spectral function smoothed in accordance with the data supplied by the spectrophotometer. On the basis of the results obtained, it can be concluded that the proposed method is suitable for automatically classifying ornamental rock. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE double layered machine learning; authorship attribution; similarity of
   documents
AB In the traditional authorship attribution task, forensic linguistic specialists analyse and compare documents to determine who was their (real) author. In the current days, the number of anonymous documents is growing ceaselessly because of Internet expansion. That is why the manual part of the authorship attribution process needs to be replaced with automatic methods. Specialized algorithms (SA) like delta-score and word length statistic were developed to quantify the similarity between documents, but currently prevailing techniques build upon the machine learning (ML) approach.
   In this paper, two machine learning approaches are compared: Single-layer ML, where the results of SA (similarities of documents) are used as input attributes for the machine learning, and Double-layer ML with the numerical information characterizing the author being extracted from documents and divided into several groups. For each group the machine learning classifier is trained and the outputs of these classifiers are used as input attributes for ML in the second step.
   Generating attributes for the machine learning in the first step of double-layer ML, which is based on SA, is described in detail here. Documents from Czech blog servers are utilized for empirical evaluation of both approaches.

AB Network Traffic Classification using classical techniques such as port number based and payload based is becoming very difficult because many applications use dynamic port number and encryption technique to avoid detection. To overcome the drawbacks of classical techniques various machine learning techniques were proposed. Machine learning technique faces the problem of labeled instances (in supervised learning) and time consuming manual work (in unsupervised learning). To address the above problems we proposed a semi supervised machine learning technique. The key idea of proposed technique is to build a classifier from training dataset consisting of both labeled and unlabeled instances. For experimental purpose KDD CUP 99 intrusion detection dataset and MATLAB tool is used. We evaluate and compare the performance of the classifier build with 10%, 20% and 30% labeled instances in training dataset. The result of experiments show that classifier build with 30% labeled instances in training dataset has better performance at number of clusters equals to 50.

The aim is to provide useful information towards the decision of which machine learning classifier to use given a particular data set. While literature already exists on comparing multiple classifiers across multiple pre-existing data sets, our approach is novel and unique in that we evolved completely new data sets designed to highlight the performance differences between supervised learning classifiers. By investigating these evolved data sets, we hope to add to the knowledge base concerning which classifiers are appropriate for specific real world classification tasks.

AB The Mental Attributes Profiling System was developed in 2002 (Laouris and Makris, Proceedings of multilingual & cross-cultural perspectives on Dyslexia, Omni Shoreham Hotel, Washington, D.C, 2002), to provide a multimodal evaluation of the learning potential and abilities of young children's brains. The method is based on the assessment of non-verbal abilities using video-like interfaces and was compared to more established methodologies in (Papadopoulos, Laouris, Makris, Proceedings of IDA 54th annual conference, San Diego, 2003), such as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Watkins et al., Psychol Sch 34(4):309-319, 1997). To do so, various tests have been applied to a population of 134 children aged 7-12 years old. This paper addresses the issue of identifying a minimal set of variables that are able to accurately predict the learning abilities of a given child. The use of Machine Learning technologies to do this provides the advantage of making no prior assumptions about the nature of the data and eliminating natural bias associated with data processing carried out by humans. Kohonen's Self Organising Maps (Kohonen, Biol Cybern 43:59-69, 1982) algorithm is able to split a population into groups based on large and complex sets of observations. Once the population is split, the individual groups can then be probed for their defining characteristics providing insight into the rationale of the split. The characteristics identified form the basis of classification systems that are able to accurately predict which group an individual will belong to, using only a small subset of the tests available. The specifics of this methodology are detailed herein, and the resulting classification systems provide an effective tool to prognose the learning abilities of new subjects.

AB Power companies can benefit from the use of knowledge discovery methods and statistical machine learning for preventive maintenance. We introduce a general process for transforming historical electrical grid data into models that aim to predict the risk of failures for components and systems. These models can be used directly by power companies to assist with prioritization of maintenance and repair work. Specialized versions of this process are used to produce 1) feeder failure rankings, 2) cable, joint, terminator, and transformer rankings, 3) feeder Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) estimates, and 4) manhole events vulnerability rankings. The process in its most general form can handle diverse, noisy, sources that are historical (static), semi-real-time, or real-time, incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for prioritization (supervised ranking or MTBF), and includes an evaluation of results via cross-validation and blind test. Above and beyond the ranked lists and MTBF estimates are business management interfaces that allow the prediction capability to be integrated directly into corporate planning and decision support; such interfaces rely on several important properties of our general modeling approach: that machine learning features are meaningful to domain experts, that the processing of data is transparent, and that prediction results are accurate enough to support sound decision making. We discuss the challenges in working with historical electrical grid data that were not designed for predictive purposes. The "rawness" of these data contrasts with the accuracy of the statistical models that can be obtained from the process; these models are sufficiently accurate to assist in maintaining New York City's electrical grid.

AB Using the theory of machine learning to spectrum cognition and management is a necessary requirement of realizing cognitive radio technology. In order to evaluate the performance of wireless channel spectrum sensing strategy effectively, the statistical mean value is put forward as evaluation criteria for the cognitive user with fixed rate service. Study shows that, for the objective license channel vacancy and occupancy state time with exponentially distribution as well as the same distribution parameter, vacancy state probability follows uniform distribution. Then, the paper analyses how the channel time detection threshold have an influence on throughput. With the increasing of sample size, the estimate of throughput converges in probability to its statistical mean value. Simulation indicates that the spectrum sensing throughput performance of the cognitive user with fixed rate service based on machine learning achieves better performance compared with random spectrum sensing. Ultimately, the channel time detection threshold is achieved when maximizing the statistical mean throughput. (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Machine learning-based prediction has been effectively applied for many healthcare applications. Predicting breast screening attendance using machine learning (prior to the actual mammogram) is a new field. This paper presents new predictor attributes for such an algorithm. It describes a new hybrid algorithm that relies on back-propagation and radial basis function-based neural networks for prediction. The algorithm has been developed in an open source-based environment. The algorithm was tested on a 13-year dataset (1995-2008). This paper compares the algorithm and validates its accuracy and efficiency with different platforms. Nearly 80% accuracy and 88% positive predictive value and sensitivity were recorded for the algorithm. The results were encouraging; 40-50% of negative predictive value and specificity warrant further work. Preliminary results were promising and provided ample amount of reasons for testing the algorithm on a larger scale.

The motion planning system is imitation learning based, which is a general approach for learning motor skills from human demonstration. This scheme of supervised learning is based on a dynamical movement primitives (DMP) as control policies (CP). The DMP is a non- linear di ff erential equation that encode movements, which are used to learn tasks in backhoe machines. A general architecture to achieve autonomous truck loading operations is described. Also, the e ff ectiveness of our approach for truck loading task is demonstrated, where the machine can adapt to different operating scenarios.

AB The growing prevalence of network attacks is a well-known problem which can impact the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of critical information for both individuals and enterprises. In this paper, we propose a real-time intrusion detection approach using a supervised machine learning technique. Our approach is simple and efficient, and can be used with many machine learning techniques. We applied different well-known machine learning techniques to evaluate the performance of our IDS approach. Our experimental results show that the Decision Tree technique can outperform the other techniques. Therefore, we further developed a real-time intrusion detection system (RT-IDS) using the Decision Tree technique to classify on-line network data as normal or attack data. We also identified 12 essential features of network data which are relevant to detecting network attacks using the information gain as our feature selection criterions. Our RT-IDS can distinguish normal network activities from main attack types (Probe and Denial of Service (DoS)) with a detection rate higher than 98% within 2 s. We also developed a new post-processing procedure to reduce the false-alarm rate as well as increase the reliability and detection accuracy of the intrusion detection system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we investigate the potential of discrete wavelet transform (DWT), together with a recently developed machine learning algorithm referred to as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), to the task of classifying EEG signals and detecting epileptic seizures. EEG signals are decomposed into frequency sub-bands using DWT, and then these sub-bands are passed to an ELM classifier. A comparative study on system performance is conducted between ELM and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN). Results show that the ELM classifier not only achieves better classification accuracy, but also needs much less learning time compared to the BPNN classifier. It is also found that the length of the EEG segment used. affects the prediction performance of classifiers.

AB Both optimization and learning play important roles in a system for intelligent tasks. On one hand, we introduce three types of optimization tasks studied in the machine learning literature, corresponding to the three levels of inverse problems in an intelligent system. Also, we discuss three major roles of convexity in machine learning, either directly towards a convex programming or approximately transferring a difficult problem into a tractable one in help of local convexity and convex duality. No doubly, a good optimization algorithm takes an essential role in a learning process and new developments in the literature of optimization may thrust the advances of machine learning. On the other hand, we also interpret that the key task of learning is not simply optimization, as sometimes misunderstood in the optimization literature. We introduce the key challenges of learning and the current status of efforts towards the challenges. Furthermore, learning versus optimization has also been examined from a unified perspective under the name of Bayesian Ying-Yang learning, with combinatorial optimization made more effectively in help of learning.

AB Web caching is a technology to improve network traffic on the Internet. It is a temporary storage of Web objects for later retrieval. Three significant advantages of Web caching include reduction in bandwidth consumption, server load, and latency. These advantages make the Web to be less expensive yet it provides better performance. This research aims to introduce an advanced machine learning method for a classification problem in Web caching that requires a decision to cache or not to cache Web objects in a proxy cache server. The challenges in this classification problem include the issues in identifying attributes ranking and improve the classification accuracy significantly. This research includes four methods that are Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF) and Tree Net (TN) for classification on Web caching. The experimental results reveal that CART performed extremely well in classifying Web objects from the existing log data with a size of Web objects as a significant attribute for Web cache performance enhancement.

AB Estimation of prostate location and volume is essential in determining a dose plan for ultrasound-guided brachytherapy, a common prostate cancer treatment. However, manual segmentation is difficult, time consuming and prone to variability. In this chapter, we present a machine learning scheme, employing a combination of fuzzy sets, wavelets and rough sets, for analyzing prostrate ultrasound images in order diagnose prostate cancer. To address the image noise problem we first utilize an algorithm based on type-II fuzzy sets to enhance the contrast of the ultrasound image. This is followed by performing a modified fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm in order to detect the boundary of the prostate pattern. Then, a wavelet features are extracted and normalized, followed by application of a rough set analysis for discrimination of different regions of interest to determine whether they represent cancer or not. The experimental results obtained, show that the overall classification accuracy offered by the employed rough set approach is high compared with other machine learning techniques including decision trees, discriminant analysis, rough neural networks, and neural networks.

AB In network intrusion detection research, one popular strategy for finding attacks is monitoring a network's activity for anomalies: deviations from profiles of normality previously learned from benign traffic, typically identified using tools borrowed from the machine learning community. However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational "real world" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.

AB Empirical studies indicate that automating the bug assignment process has the potential to significantly reduce software evolution effort and costs. Prior work has used machine learning techniques to automate bug assignment but has employed a narrow band of tools which can be ineffective in large, long-lived software projects. To redress this situation, in this paper we employ a comprehensive set of machine learning tools and a probabilistic graph-based model (bug tossing graphs) that lead to highly-accurate predictions, and lay the foundation for the next generation of machine learning-based bug assignment. Our work is the first to examine the impact of multiple machine learning dimensions (classifiers, attributes, and training history) along with bug tossing graphs on prediction accuracy in bug assignment. We validate our approach on Mozilla and Eclipse, covering 856,259 bug reports and 21 cumulative years of development. We demonstrate that our techniques can achieve up to 86.09% prediction accuracy in bug assignment and significantly reduce tossing path lengths. We show that for our data sets the Naive Bayes classifier coupled with product-component features, tossing graphs and incremental learning performs best. Next, we perform an ablative analysis by unilaterally varying classifiers, features, and learning model to show their relative importance of on bug assignment accuracy. Finally, we propose optimization techniques that achieve high prediction accuracy while reducing training and prediction time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Data mining has become an important task of today's rich information environments. Strong results are obtained through accurate historical reporting. Inaccurate and dirty records yield weak and wrong analysis. Unfortunately, organizations store addresses in unstructured formats resulting in multiple representations of same entities. These addresses need. to be cleansed before they can be used in mining data. In this paper we present a supervised machine learning procedure, Hidden Markov Model (HMM). This automated probabilistic approach is used to segment a set of Asian addresses into their atomic units and standardize them. Results of this technique show that it can also be used to standardize even a large set of complex and un-formatted addresses.

AB Neural network systems are highly capable of deriving knowledge from complex data, and they are used to extract patterns and trends which are otherwise hidden in many applications. Preserving the privacy of sensitive data and individuals' information is a major challenge in many of these applications. One of the most popular algorithms in neural network learning systems is the back-propagation (BP) algorithm, which is designed for single-layer and multi-layer models and can be applied to continuous data and differentiable activation functions. Another recently introduced learning technique is the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. Although it works only on single-layer models. ELM can out-perform the BP algorithm by reducing the communication required between parties in the learning phase. In this paper, we present new privacy-preserving protocols for both the BP and ELM algorithms when data is horizontally and vertically partitioned among several parties. These new protocols, which preserve the privacy of both the input data and the constructed learning model, can be applied to online incoming records and/or batch learning. Furthermore, the final model is securely shared among all parties, who can use it jointly to predict the corresponding output for their target data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most existing intrusion detection systems use all data features to detect intrusions, some of these features are redundant and irrelevant, which can affect the detection process. Dimensionality reduction is a technique that helps solving the high dimensionality problem and has been extensively studied and widely applied in different application. In this paper we evaluate the performance of two machines learning, SVM and MLP, in a binary classification (attack/normal), using some feature selection techniques. In our experiments, we use the well know kddcup 99 data set, a standard benchmark for intrusion detection evaluation from MIT's Lincoln Lab developed for the KDD (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining concurrence) competition designed by DARPPA.
   The results obtained show the advantage of incorporating feature selection step in the process of classification. This procedure allows from one hand a clear improvement in performance when the irrelevant features are removed, and secondly, a significant reduction in the computational cost.

AB Machine Learning has been used to automatically generate a probabilistic food-web from Farm Scale Evaluation (FSE) data. The initial food web proposed by machine learning has been examined by domain experts and comparison with the literature shows that many of the links are corroborated. The FSE data were collected using two different sampling techniques, namely Vortis and pitfall. The corroboration of the initial Vortis food web, generated by machine learning, was performed manually by the domain experts. However, manual corroboration of hypothetical trophic links is difficult and requires significant amounts of time. In this paper we review the method and the main results on machine learning of trophic links. We study common trophic links from Vortis and pitfall data. We also describe a new method and present initial results on automatic corroboration of trophic links using text mining.

AB Credit assessment has attracted more and more attention from financial institutions because credit card plays more and more important role to people in the applications of electronic commerce. Recently, lot of algorithms in data mining and machine learning communities are introduced for efficient credit assessment. Ensemble learning is technique that trains a set of component classifiers and then combines their predictions to classify new patterns. As one of the four current directions in machine learning, ensemble learning can improve the generalization ability effectively and has been successfully applied in many fields. Decision tree is very popular and powerful tool in machine learning community and the rules generated by decision tree are simple and accurate for most problems. In this paper, a novel hybrid algorithm based on two machine learning techniques, i.e., decision tree and ensemble learning, is proposed to improve the performance of credit assessment. Experiments of different methods are conducted on common benchmarks and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance obviously.

ID APPROXIMATION
AB Image deblurring is a basic and important task of image processing. Traditional filtering based image deblurring methods, e.g. enhancement filters, partial differential equation (PDE) and etc., are limited by the hypothesis that natural images and noise are with low and high frequency terms, respectively. Noise removal and edge protection are always the dilemma for traditional models.
   In this paper, we study image deblurring problem from a brand new perspective-classification. And we also generalize the traditional PDE model to a more general case, using the theories of calculus of variations. Furthermore, inspired by the theories of approximation of functions, we transform the operator-learning problem into a coefficient-learning problem by means of selecting a group of basis, and build a filter-learning model. Based on extreme learning machine (ELM) [1-4], an algorithm is designed and a group of filters are learned effectively. Then a generalized image deblurring model, learned filtering PDE (LF-PDE), is built.
   The experiments verify the effectiveness of our models and the corresponding learned filters. It is shown that our model can overcome many drawbacks of the traditional models and achieve much better results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study explored the use of machine learning to automatically evaluate the accuracy of students' written explanations of evolutionary change. Performance of the Summarization Integrated Development Environment (SIDE) program was compared to human expert scoring using a corpus of 2,260 evolutionary explanations written by 565 undergraduate students in response to two different evolution instruments (the EGALT-F and EGALT-P) that contained prompts that differed in various surface features (such as species and traits). We tested human-SIDE scoring correspondence under a series of different training and testing conditions, using Kappa inter-rater agreement values of greater than 0.80 as a performance benchmark. In addition, we examined the effects of response length on scoring success; that is, whether SIDE scoring models functioned with comparable success on short and long responses. We found that SIDE performance was most effective when scoring models were built and tested at the individual item level and that performance degraded when suites of items or entire instruments were used to build and test scoring models. Overall, SIDE was found to be a powerful and cost-effective tool for assessing student knowledge and performance in a complex science domain.

AB This work presents a framework for detecting anomalies in servers leading to crash such as memory leaks in aging systems and proactively rejuvenating them.
   Proactive VM-rejuvenation framework has been extended with machine learning techniques. Utilization of the framework is allowing the effect of software failures virtually to be reduced to zero downtime. It can be applied against internal anomalies like memory leaks in the web servers and external as Denial of Service Attacks. The framework has been implemented with virtual machines and a machine learning algorithm has been realized for successfully determining a decision rule for proactively initiating the system rejuvenation. The proposed framework has been theoretically justified and experimentally validated.

DE implanted malicious code; incompletely specified system; machine

AB In 2009 UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1, an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, was replaced by a version with a backdoor at its mirror sites. It was not detected until seven months later and it had caused irrevocable damages in IRC services. It is of vital importance and also a challenge to detect implanted malicious code in newly developed systems before their deployment.
   We apply machine learning to uncover a system implementation structure that includes its normal functions from the design, as well as the hidden malicious behaviors. Published works with machine learning often assume that systems are completely specified. Unfortunately, practical system implementations are usually incompletely specified and the prevalent algorithms do not apply. We design generalized and efficient machine learning algorithms for incompletely specified protocol system implementations for detecting implanted malicious code. We further extend the results where machine learning starts from an approximate model instead of an empty conjecture - a usual approach of machine learning algorithms, and our approach learns an implementation structure more efficiently than the known algorithms. We implement and apply our method to two case studies: an IRC server with backdoor and an MSN client with message flooder. Experiments show that our procedures successfully and efficiently detect the implanted malicious behaviors.

AB In this study, we present the investigations being pursued in our research laboratory on magnetic resonance images ( MRI) of various states of brain by extracting the most significant features, and to classify them into normal and abnormal brain images. We propose a novel method based ondeep and extreme machine learning on wavelet transform to initially decompose the images, and then use various features selection and search algorithms to extract the most significant features of brain from the MRI images. By using a comparative study with different classifiers to detect the abnormality of brain images from publicly available neuro-imaging dataset, we found that a principled approach involving wavelet based feature extraction, followed by selection of most significant features using PCA technique, and the classification using deep and extreme machine learning based classifiers results in a significant improvement in accuracy and faster training and testing time as compared to previously reported studies.

The latter parameters can be used for the implementation of intelligent modeling methods like artificial neural networks in order to assess the exercise technique automatically and provide the athlete with appropriate feedback. First results of the developed classifiers indicate good performance values and high classification rates, demonstrating a significant potential of machine learning routines for the autonomous evaluation of performances on weight machines.

TI Interior-Point Methods in Machine Learning
SO OPTIMIZATION FOR MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
ID POLYNOMIAL-TIME ALGORITHM; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEWTON
AB Interior-point methods for linear and (convex) quadratic programming display several features which make them particularly attractive for very large-scale optimization. They have an impressive low-degree polynomial worst-case complexity. In practice, they display an unrivalled ability to deliver optimal solutions in an almost constant number of iterations which depends very little, if at all, on the problem's dimension. Since many problems in machine learning can be recast as linear or quadratic optimization problems and it is common for them to have large or huge sizes, interior-point methods are natural candidates to be applied in this context.
   In this chapter we will discuss several major issues related to interior point methods, including the worst-case complexity result, the features responsible for their ability to solve very large problems, and their existing and potential applications in machine learning.

ID FUZZY MEASURES; MODEL; NETWORKS
AB The fundamental game of real-time strategy (RTS) is collecting resources to build an army with military units to kill and destroy enemy units. In this research, an extreme learning machine (ELM) model is proposed for RTS game strategy evaluation. Due to the complicated game rules and numerous playable items, the commonly used tree-based decision models become complex, sometimes even unmanageable. Since complex interactions exist among unit types, the weighted average model usually cannot be well used to compute the combined power of unit groups, which results in misleading unit generation strategy. Fuzzy measures and integrals are often used to handle interactions among attributes, but they cannot handle the predefined unit production sequence which is strictly required in RTS games. In this paper, an ELM model is trained based on real data to obtain the combined power of units in different types. Both the unit interactions and the production sequence can be implicitly and simultaneously handled by this model. Warcraft III battle data from real players are collected and used in our experiments. Experimental results show that ELM is fast and effective in evaluating the unit generation strategies.

AB Machine learning is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to change behavior based on data, such as from sensor data or databases. They exist a number of authors have applied genetic algorithms (GA) to the problem of K-clustering, where the required number of clusters is known. Various algorithms are used to enable the GAs to cluster and to enhance their performance, but there is little or no comparison between the different algorithms. It is not clear which algorithms are best suited to the clustering problem, or how any adaptions will affect GA performance for differing data sets. In this article we shall compare a number of algorithms of GA appropriate for the k-clustering problem with some distributions of the collections Reuters 21578, including some used for more general grouping problem.

AB Heulandite and clinoptilolite form the most abundant family of natural zeolite crystals. The topology of both of them is characterized by the framework type HEU. Despite many studies on these crystals the, mineral assignment to a zeolite as heulandite or clinoptilolite is still controversial and unresolved today. Based on a machine learning clustering analysis of crystallographic data of zeolite crystals, we show that zeolites belonging to the HEU framework type are divided into three groups of minerals instead of two. Two of the groups, HEU-h and HEU-c, contain crystals with names heulandite and clinoptilolite, respectively. The third newly proposed group HEU-m is composed of mixed zeolites named under both traditional names. The grouping is based on the EM algorithm and a set of descriptors built from data collected in the NIST/FIZ Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. Verification of the division of the HEU family into three groups is provided based on a battery of machine learning tests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Distributed knowledge has attracted more and more attention as a way to improve knowledge sharing across the world using the Internet. This paradigm enables many systems to interact with each other and share their knowledge while keeping their own ontology. Several researchers have worked on this topic with different strategies but they all argue that the main issue is to make sure that the other systems understand the concepts of its domain correctly. In order to be sure that they understand each other, systems use concept learning to learn the meaning of concepts they communicate with. In this paper, we try to overcome this complexity by suggesting a system that enables agents to learn new concepts from several different agents at the same time and each agent has its own ontology. We use social networks paradigm to communicate between agents to enhance the accuracy of learning process.

LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB The purpose of this chapter is to present fundamental ideas and techniques of machine learning suitable for the field of this book, i.e., for automated scientific discovery. The chapter focuses on those symbolic machine learning methods, which produce results that are suitable to be interpreted and understood by humans. This is particularly important ill the context of automated scientific discovery as the scientific theories to be produced by machines are usually meant to be interpreted by humans.
   This chapter contains some of the most influential ideas and concepts ill machine learning research to give the reader a basic insight into the field. After the introduction in Sect. 1, general ideas of flow learning problems call be framed are given in Sect. 2. The section provides useful perspectives to better understand what learning algorithms actually do. Section 3 presents the Version space model which is an early learning algorithm as well as a conceptual framework, that provides important insight into the general mechanisms behind most learning algorithms. In section 4, a family of learning, algorithms, the AQ family for learning classification rules is presented. The AQ family belongs to the early approaches in machine learning. The next, Sect. 5 presents the basic principles of decision tree learners. Decision tree learners belong to the most influential class of inductive learning algorithms today. Finally, a more recent group of learning systems are presented in Sect. 6, which learn relational concepts within the framework of logic programming. This is a particularly interesting group of learning systems since the framework allows also to incorporate background knowledge which may assist in generalisation. Section 7 discusses Association Rules - a technique that comes from the related field of Data mining. Section 8 presents the basic idea of the Naive Bayesian Classifier. While this is a very popular learning technique, the learning result is not well suited for human comprehension as it is essentially a large collection of probability values. In Sect. 9, we present a generic method for improving accuracy of a given learner by L,encratin2 multiple classifiers using variations of the training data. While this works well in most cases, the resulting classifiers have significantly increased complexity and, hence, tend to destroy the human readability of the learning result that a single learner may produce. Section 10 contains a summary, mentions briefly other techniques not discussed in this chapter and presents outlook on the potential of machine learning in the future.

AB Scheduling with learning effects has received growing attention nowadays. A well-known learning model is called "sum-of processing-times-based learning" in which the actual processing time of a job is a non-increasing function of the jobs already processed. However, the actual processing time of a given job drops to zero precipitously when the normal job processing times are large. Motivated by this observation, we propose a truncation learning model where the actual job processing time is a function which depends not only on the processing times of the jobs already processed but also on a control parameter. The use of the truncated function is to model the phenomenon that the learning of a human activity is limited. Under the proposed learning model, we show that some single-machine scheduling problems can be solved in polynomial time. In addition, we further provide the worst-case error bounds for the problems to minimize the maximum lateness and total weighted completion time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Prior domain knowledge; Inductive machine learning; Imbalance data;
   Support vector machine
AB When dealing with real-world problems, there is considerable amount of prior domain knowledge that can provide insights on various aspect of the problem. On the other hand, many machine learning methods rely solely on the data sets for their learning phase and do not take into account any explicitly expressed domain knowledge. This paper proposes a framework that investigates and enables the incorporation of prior domain knowledge with respect to three key characteristics of inductive machine learning algorithms: consistency, generalization and convergence. The framework is used to review, classify and analyse key existing approaches to incorporating domain knowledge into inductive machine learning, as well as to consider the risks of doing so. The paper also demonstrates the design of a novel hierarchical semi-parametric machine learning method, capable of incorporating prior domain knowledge. The method-VQSVM-extends the support vector machine (SVM) family of methods with vector quantization (VQ) techniques to address the problem of learning from imbalanced data sets. The paper presents the results of testing the method on a collection of imbalanced data sets with various imbalance ratios and various numbers of subclasses. The learning process of the VQSVM method utilizes some domain knowledge to solve problem of fitting imbalance data. The experiments in the paper demonstrate that enabling the incorporation of prior domain knowledge into the SVM framework is an effective way to overcome the sensitivity of SVM towards the imbalance ratio in a data set.

DE speech synthesis; unit selection; machine learning
AB We show that a ranking model produced by machine learning outperforms two baselines when applied to the task of selecting texts for use in creating a unit-selection synthesis voice with good domain coverage. The model learns to predict the estimated utility of an utterance based on features relating it to the utterances selected so far and a corpus of target utterances. Our analyses indicate that our discriminative approach continues to work well even though the presence of rich prosodic and non-prosodic features significantly expands the search space beyond what has previously been handled by greedy methods.

AB One of the biggest challenges for both network administrators and researchers is detecting anomalies in network traffic. If they had a tool that could accurately and expeditiously detect these anomalies, they would prevent many of the serious problems caused by them. We conducted experiments in order to study the relationship between interval-based features of network traffic and several types of network anomalies by using two famous machine learning algorithms: the naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor. Our findings will help researchers and network administrators to select effective interval-based features for each particular type of anomaly, and to choose a proper machine learning algorithm for their own network system.

AB Chemogenomics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that lies in the interface of biology, chemistry, and informatics. Most of the currently used drugs are small molecules that interact with proteins. Understanding protein-ligand interaction is therefore central to drug discovery and design. In the subfield of chemogenomics known as proteochemometrics, protein-ligand-interaction models are induced from data matrices that consist of both protein and ligand information along with some experimentally measured variable. The two general aims of this quantitative multi-structure-property-relationship modeling (QMSPR) approach are to exploit sparse/incomplete information sources and to obtain more general models covering larger parts of the protein-ligand space, than traditional approaches that focuses mainly on specific targets or ligands. The data matrices, usually obtained from multiple sparse/incomplete sources, typically contain series of proteins and ligands together with quantitative information about their interactions. A useful model should ideally be easy to interpret and generalize well to new unseen protein-ligand combinations. Resolving this requires sophisticated machine-learning methods for model induction, combined with adequate validation. This review is intended to provide a guide to methods and data sources suitable for this kind of protein-ligand-interaction modeling. An overview of the modeling process is presented including data collection, protein and ligand descriptor computation, data preprocessing, machine-learning-model induction and validation. Concerns and issues specific for each step in this kind of data-driven modeling will be discussed.

AB This paper proposes new cognitive algorithms and mechanisms for detecting 0day attacks targeting the Internet and its communication performances and behavior. For this purpose, this work relies on the use of machine learning techniques able to issue autonomously traffic models and new attack signatures when new attacks are detected, characterized and classified as such. The ultimate goal deals with being able to instantaneously deploy new defense strategies when a new 0day attack is encountered, thanks to an autonomous cognitive system. The algorithms and mechanisms are validated through extensive experiments taking advantage of real traffic traces captured on the Renater network as well as on a WIDE transpacific link between Japan and the USA.

AB Currently, information technology (IT) is playing a significant role in the development of learning environments. The integration of IT into the classroom provides innovative learning environments that allow for more interactive, relevant, and effective applications to give students valuable experiences. This article presents the design and implementation of more active and collaborative methods of teaching and learning in a course on mechanisms and machine dynamics. Through the use of virtual collaborative environments such as cooperative learning, problem-based learning (PBL), critical thinking, and more in the context of IT-enabled environments, students are given the opportunity to experiment with ideas and see the results of their efforts on the computer screen. These interactive learning modules impose more responsibility on students for their own learning than the traditional lecture-based passive learning methodology. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   learning approach; conditional random fields; transfer learning
AB Spoken language understanding (SLU) has received recent interest as a component of spoken dialogue systems to infer intentions of the speaker and to provide natural human-centric interfaces for ambient intelligence. The goal of SLU is to map natural language speech to a frame structure that encodes its meaning. While most approaches based on rule-based parsing often succeeded before the 1990s, for academic and industrial fields the paradigm has shifted from knowledge-based to statistical. Statistical SLU automatically learns patterns from data in a supervised or semi-supervised fashion. The statistical framework is growing into a more powerful tool for SLU using modern machine learning methods. This chapter discusses the concept of learning to understand human language using modern machine learning techniques, and presents a machine learning-based formalism for modeling the SLU problem, focusing on goal-oriented slot-filling dialogue systems. It also addresses some advanced issues that should be examined for ambient intelligence environments. To reduce computational costs, we present efficient algorithms for learning and applying SLU, because some applications for ambient intelligence have limited computation resources. Then we describe a transfer learning framework for SLU modeling, in which multiple tasks and domain knowledge can be incorporated. Finally, to assess the feasibility of our methods, two novel problems for statistical SLU are demonstrated.

During the last decade, chemoinformatics - briefly defined as informatics applied on chemical data - has gained much importance due to the economical benefits obtained from the application of in silico (i.e., computer-based) models. Prediction of candidate compounds for medicinal use is a hard task due to the complex and usually unknown relationships between structure and biological properties. This short article aims at summarizing the main contributions of a PhD thesis [PhD thesis, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina, 2010] and, at the same time, at encouraging research on this challenging area.

DE Differential Privacy; Privacy Preserving Classification; Ensemble
   Machine Learning
AB Many organizations transact in large amounts of data often containing personal identifiable information (PII) and various confidential data. Such organizations are bound by state, federal, and international laws to ensure that the confidentiality of both individuals and sensitive data is not compromised. However, during the privacy preserving process, the utility of such datasets diminishes even while confidentiality is achieved--a problem that has been defined as NP-Hard. In this paper, we investigate a differential privacy machine learning ensemble classifier approach that seeks to preserve data privacy while maintaining an acceptable level of utility. The first step of the methodology applies a strong data privacy granting technique on a dataset using differential privacy. The resulting perturbed data is then passed through a machine learning ensemble classifier, which aims to reduce the classification error, or, equivalently, to increase utility. Then, the association between increasing the number of weak decision tree learners and data utility, which informs us as to whether the ensemble machine learner would classify more correctly is examined. As results, we found that a combined adjustment of the privacy granting noise parameters and an increase in the number of weak learners in the ensemble machine might lead to a lower classification error.

AB E-bussiness has grown rapidly in the last decade and massive amount of data on customer purchases, browsing pattern and preferences has been generated. Classification of electronic data plays a pivotal role to mine the valuable information and thus has become one of the most important applications of E-bussiness. Support Vector Machines are popular and powerful machine learning techniques, and they offer state-of-the-art performance. Rough set theory is a formal mathematical tool to deal with incomplete or imprecise information and one of its important applications is feature selection. In this paper, rough set theory and support vector machines are combined to construct a classification model to classify the data of E-bussiness effectively.

AB Evolutionary algorithms have been successfully applied to design fuzzy rule-based classifiers. They are used for attribute selection, fuzzy set selection, rule selection, membership function tuning, and so on. Genetics-based machine learning (GBML) is one of the promising evolutionary algorithms for classifier design. It can find an appropriate combination of antecedent sets for each rule in a classifier. Although GBML has high search ability, it needs long computation time especially for large data sets. In this paper, we apply a parallel distributed implementation to our fuzzy genetics-based machine learning. In our method, we divide not only a population but also a training data set into subgroups. These subgroups are assigned to CPU cores. Through computational experiments on large data sets, we show the effectiveness of the proposed parallel distributed implementation.

AB A machine learning technique is presented for assessing brain tumor progression by exploring six patients' complete MRI records scanned during their visits in the past two years. There are ten MRI series, including diffusion tensor image (DTI), for each visit. After registering all series to the corresponding DTI scan at the first visit, annotated normal and tumor regions were overlaid. Intensity value of each pixel inside the annotated regions were then extracted across all of the ten MRI series to compose a 10 dimensional vector. Each feature vector falls into one of three categories: normal, tumor, and normal but progressed to tumor at a later time. In this preliminary study, we focused on the trend of brain tumor progression during three consecutive visits, i.e., visit A, B, and C. A machine learning algorithm was trained using the data containing information from visit A to visit B, and the trained model was used to predict tumor progression from visit A to visit C. Preliminary results showed that prediction for brain tumor progression is feasible. An average of 80.9% pixel-wise accuracy was achieved for tumor progression prediction at visit C.

ID MANAGEMENT ZONES; REGIONALIZATION
AB Machine learning techniques typically result from the need for intelligent solutions to practical tasks. Nowadays, large data volumes are usually involved and machine learning techniques are focused on particular tasks like classification, regression or clustering. For the latter task, clustering, quite a few algorithms have been proposed, typically tailored to particular application domains and their data sets. Recently, georeferenced (or spatial) data sets keep emerging in lots of disciplines. Therefore, algorithms which are able to handle these spatial data sets should be developed. This article shortly describes a particular application area, precision agriculture, and the spatial data sets which exist there. A particular task from this area, management zone delineation, is outlined and existing spatial clustering algorithms are evaluated for this task. Based on the experiences with those algorithms and a few requirements, HACC-SPATIAL is developed. The algorithm is based on hierarchical agglomerative clustering with a spatial constraint and it is demonstrated to produce practically advantageous results on precision agriculture data sets.

AB Machine learning methods have been applied to classifying fMRI scans by studying locations in the brain that exhibit temporal intensity variation between groups, frequently reporting classification accuracy of 90% or better. Although empirical results are quite favorable, one might doubt the ability of classification methods to withstand changes in task ordering and the reproducibility of activation patterns over runs, and question how much of the classification machines' power is due to artifactual noise versus genuine neurological signal. To examine the true strength and power of machine learning classifiers we create and then deconstruct a classifier to examine its sensitivity to physiological noise, task reordering, and across-scan classification ability. The models are trained and tested both within and across runs to assess stability and reproducibility across conditions. We demonstrate the use of independent components analysis for both feature extraction and artifact removal and show that removal of such artifacts can reduce predictive accuracy even when data has been cleaned in the preprocessing stages. We demonstrate how mistakes in the feature selection process can cause the cross-validation error seen in publication to be a biased estimate of the testing error seen in practice and measure this bias by purposefully making flawed models. We discuss other ways to introduce bias and the statistical assumptions lying behind the data and model themselves. Finally we discuss the complications in drawing inference from the smaller sample sizes typically seen in fMRI studies, the effects of small or unbalanced samples on the Type 1 and Type 2 error rates, and how publication bias can give a false confidence of the power of such methods. Collectively this work identifies challenges specific to fMRI classification and methods affecting the stability of models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Various machine learning techniques have been applied to different problems in survival analysis in the last decade. They were usually adapted to learning from censored survival data by using the information on observation time. This includes learning from parts of the data or interventions to the learning algorithms. Efficient models were established in various fields of clinical medicine and bioinformatics. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing method for adapting the censored survival data to be used with ordinary machine learning algorithms. This is done by pre-assigning censored instances a positive or negative outcome according to their features and observation time. The proposed procedure calculates the goodness of fit of each censored instance to both the distribution of positives and the spoiled distribution of negatives in the entire dataset and relabels that instance accordingly. We performed a thorough empirical testing of our method in a simulation study and on two real-world medical datasets, using the naive Bayes classifier and decision trees. When compared to one of the popular ML methods dealing with survival, our method provided good results, especially when applied to heavily censored data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a new interactive workbench RDRCE (RDR Case Explorer) to facilitate the combination of Machine Learning and manual Knowledge Acquisition for Natural Language Processing problems. We show how to use Brill's well regarded transformational learning approach and convert its results into an RDR tree. RDRCE then strongly guides the systematic inspection of the generated RDR tree in order to further refine and improve it by manually adding more rules. Furthermore, RDRCE also helps in quickly recognising potential noise in the training data and allows to deal with noise effectively. Finally, we present a first study using RDRCE to build a high-quality Part-of-Speech tagger for English. After some 60 hours of manual knowledge acquisition, we already exceed slightly the state-of-the art performance on unseen benchmark test data and the fruits of some 15 years of further research in learning methods for Part-of-Speech taggers.

AB We explore the problem of learning and predicting popularity of articles from online news media. The only available information we exploit is the textual content of the articles and the information whether they became popular by users clicking on them or not. First we show that this problem cannot be solved satisfactorily in a naive way by modelling it as a binary classification problem. Next, we cast this problem as a ranking task of pairs of popular and non-popular articles and show that this approach can reach accuracy of up to 76%. Finally we show that prediction performance can improve if more content-based features are used. For all experiments, Support Vector Machines approaches are used.

AB Whenever machine learning is used to prevent illegal or unsanctioned activity and there is an economic incentive, adversaries will attempt to circumvent the protection provided. Constraints on how adversaries can manipulate training and test data for classifiers used to detect suspicious behavior make problems in this area tractable and interesting. This special issue highlights papers that span many disciplines including email spam detection, computer intrusion detection, and detection of web pages deliberately designed to manipulate the priorities of pages returned by modern search engines. The four papers in this special issue provide a standard taxonomy of the types of attacks that can be expected in an adversarial framework, demonstrate how to design classifiers that are robust to deleted or corrupted features, demonstrate the ability of modern polymorphic engines to rewrite malware so it evades detection by current intrusion detection and antivirus systems, and provide approaches to detect web pages designed to manipulate web page scores returned by search engines. We hope that these papers and this special issue encourages the multidisciplinary cooperation required to address many interesting problems in this relatively new area including predicting the future of the arms races created by adversarial learning, developing effective long-term defensive strategies, and creating algorithms that can process the massive amounts of training and test data available for internet-scale problems.

AB For multivariate chaotic time series prediction problem, a prediction based on input variable selection and extreme learning machine is proposed in this paper. The multivariate chaotic time series is reconstructed in phase space, and a mutual information based method is used to select the input variables, which have high statistics information with the output variables. The extreme learning machine is conducted to model the multivariate chaotic time series in the phase space by utilizing its approximation capability. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, a model selection algorithm is conducted for extreme learning machine to choose an expected minimum risk prediction model. Simulation results based on Lorenz, Rossler multivariate chaotic time series and Rossler hyperchaotic time series show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB We propose using machine learning techniques to analyze the shape of living cells in phase-contrast microscopy images. Large scale studies of cell shape are needed to understand the response of cells to their environment. Manual analysis of thousands of microscopy images, however, is time-consuming and error-prone and necessitates automated tools. We show how a combination of shape-based and appearance-based features of fibroblast cells can be used to classify their morphological state, using the Adaboost algorithm. The classification accuracy of our method approaches the agreement between two expert observers. We also address the important issue of clutter mitigation by developing a machine learning approach to distinguish between clutter and cells in time-lapse microscopy image sequences.

AB Sequence classification is one of the most fundamental machine learning tasks in computational biology nowadays. With the wide availability of large corpora of annotated sequences, the use of supervised learning techniques can greatly speed up the process of identifying new sequences sharing certain function or properties. Many methods have been proposed over the years and we hope to provide an introduction to some of the more prominent ones by focussing on protease cleavage prediction: a typical representative of this class of problem. The variety of proteolytic action modes between cysteine-proteases covers a broad range of complexity level and feature specificity, illustrating the strengths and limitations of the different machine learning techniques used on them.
   This review briefly introduces the particulars of predicting cleavage by calpains and caspases. We then offer some general practical considerations on treating sequences for use with machine learning algorithms, before covering specific methods. The methods presented range from basic position-based statistical models to more technically advanced methods such as Markov models or kernel-based algorithms, as well as methods with more restricted goals such as decision trees. With each family of algorithms, examples of implementations are introduced and their performances compared, along with particular strengths and weaknesses.
   With this review, we aim to provide useful elements of decision toward choosing an existing method or developing a new one, based on the complexity and specific needs of a given sequence classification problem.

AB Mammographic risk analysis is an important and challenging issue in modern medical science; research and development in this area has recently attracted much attention. Many efforts have been devoted to achieving a higher accuracy in such analysis. This paper presents a novel approach for automated analysis of mammographic risk, in support of human consultant estimation of such risk. The underlying approach is general, it combines evolutionary computation with extreme learning machine to efficiently train effective fuzzy systems. The proposed approach is experimentally compared to a number of state-of-the-art learning classifiers that can also be adopted to analyze mammographic risk. The significance of this work is highlighted by its improved performance over the alternative approaches, measured using criteria such as classification accuracy and confusion matrices. The results demonstrate that for the problem of mammographic risk analysis, evolutionary fuzzy extreme learning machine entails such performance both at the overall image level and at the level of individual risk types.

AB In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of a number of commonly used amino acid encodings by using artificial neural networks and substitution scoring matrices. An important step in many machine learning techniques applied in computational biology is encoding the symbolic data of protein sequences reasonably efficient in numeric vector representations. This encoding can be achieved by either considering the amino acid physicochemical properties or a generic numerical encoding. In order to be effective in the context of a machine learning system, an encoding must preserve information relative to the problem at hand, while diminishing superfluous data. To this end, it is important to measure how much an encoding scheme can conserve the underlying similarities and differences that exist among the amino acids. One way to evaluate the effectiveness of an amino acid encoding scheme is to compare it to the roles that amino acids are actually found to play in biological systems. A numerical representation of the similarities and differences between amino acids can be found in substitution matrices commonly used for sequence alignment, since these substitution matrices are based on measures of the interchangeability of amino acids in biological specimens. In this study, a new encoding scheme is also proposed based on the genetic codon coding occurs during protein synthesis. The experimental results indicate better performances compared to the other commonly used encodings.

AB This paper is the result of a search for a method for machine learning in Geographic Information Systems applications. GIS is basically a complex database system that stores and manipulates graphics map data with analytical capabilities.Machine learning can be employed in extracting information from the graphical and attribute data sets already stored in a GIS by means of various machine learning techniques, GIS is used to generate spatial variables data as an input to a machine learning tool. For the application of Neural Networks (NN) method, Weka data mining suite has been used with multi-layer perceptron algorithm.
   The proposed solution requires 13 attributes including direct weather inputs (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and rain) which are used as input within a geographic grid (area) system, for predicting forest fires. It creates a model of prediction on the data obtained from the past occurences of forest fires. The results which have geographic references with a grid system can be used in preparing "Risk Mapping", damage assessment and planning of the resource allocation in fighting forest fires.

AB In this work, we propose a novel method for the regularization of blind deconvolution algorithms. The proposed method employs example-based machine learning techniques for modeling the space of point spread functions. During an iterative blind deconvolution process, a prior term attracts the point spread function estimates to the learned point spread function space. We demonstrate the usage of this regularizer within a Bayesian blind deconvolution framework and also integrate into the latter a method for noise reduction, thus creating a complete blind deconvolution method. The application of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on synthetic and real-world three-dimensional images acquired by a wide-field fluorescence microscope, where the need for blind deconvolution algorithms is indispensable, yielding excellent results.

AB Tuning compiler optimizations for rapidly evolving hardware makes porting and extending an optimizing compiler for each new platform extremely challenging. Iterative optimization is a popular approach to adapting programs to a new architecture automatically using feedback-directed compilation. However, the large number of evaluations required for each program has prevented iterative compilation from widespread take-up in production compilers. Machine learning has been proposed to tune optimizations across programs systematically but is currently limited to a few transformations, long training phases and critically lacks publicly released, stable tools. Our approach is to develop a modular, extensible, self-tuning optimization infrastructure to automatically learn the best optimizations across multiple programs and architectures based on the correlation between program features, run-time behavior and optimizations. In this paper we describe Milepost GCC, the first publicly-available open-source machine learning-based compiler. It consists of an Interactive Compilation Interface (ICI) and plugins to extract program features and exchange optimization data with the cTuning.org open public repository. It automatically adapts the internal optimization heuristic at function-level granularity to improve execution time, code size and compilation time of a new program on a given architecture. Part of the MILEPOST technology together with low-level ICI-inspired plugin framework is now included in the mainline GCC. We developed machine learning plugins based on probabilistic and transductive approaches to predict good combinations of optimizations. Our preliminary experimental results show that it is possible to automatically reduce the execution time of individual MiBench programs, some by more than a factor of 2, while also improving compilation time and code size. On average we are able to reduce the execution time of the MiBench benchmark suite by 11% for the ARC reconfigurable processor. We also present a realistic multi-objective optimization scenario for Berkeley DB library using Milepost GCC and improve execution time by approximately 17%, while reducing compilation time and code size by 12% and 7% respectively on Intel Xeon processor.

AB Machine learning, data mining, and several related research areas are concerned with methods for the automated induction of models and the extraction of interesting patterns from empirical data. Automated knowledge acquisition of that kind has been an essential aspect of artificial intelligence since a long time and has more recently also attracted considerable attention in the fuzzy sets community. This paper briefly reviews some typical applications and highlights potential contributions that fuzzy set theory can make to machine learning, data mining, and related fields. In this connection, some advantages of fuzzy methods for representing and mining vague patterns in data are especially emphasized. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB With several good research groups actively working in machine learning (ML) approaches, we have now the concept of self-containing machine learning solutions that oftentimes work out-of-the-box leading to the concept of ML black-boxes. Although it is important to have such black-boxes helping researchers to deal with several problems nowadays, it comes with an inherent problem increasingly more evident: we have observed that researchers and students are progressively relying on ML black-boxes and, usually, achieving results without knowing the machinery of the classifiers. In this regard, this paper discusses the use of machine learning black-boxes and poses the question of how far we can get using these out-of-the-box solutions instead of going deeper into the machinery of the classifiers. The paper focuses on three aspects of classifiers: (1) the way they compare examples in the feature space; (2) the impact of using features with variable dimensionality; and (3) the impact of using binary classifiers to solve a multi-class problem. We show how knowledge about the classifier's machinery can improve the results way beyond out-of-the-box machine learning solutions.

AB Activity recognition based on mobile device is an important aspect in developing human-centric pervasive applications like gaming, industrial maintenance and health monitoring. However, the data distribution of accelerometer is heavily affected by varying device locations and orientations, which will degrade the performance of recognition model. To solve this problem, we propose a fast, robust and device displacement free activity recognition model in this paper, which integrates principal component analysis (PCA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) to realize location-adaptive activity recognition. On the one hand, PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of feature space and extract robust features for recognition. On the other hand, in the online phase ELM is applied to classify the activity and adapt the recognition model to new device locations based on high confident recognition results in real time. Experimental results show that, with robust features and fast adaptation capability, the proposed model can adapt the classifier to new device locations quickly and obtain good recognition performance.

AB With the rapid advancement of information technology, flood of digital data collected by business, government, and scientific applications need analyzing, digesting, and understanding. Scalability has become a necessity for data mining algorithms to process large data more effectively and extract insightful information from large data. In this paper a scaling up neural network learning algorithm is presented, which partitions a large data set into subsets, applies learning algorithm on each subset concurrently and then integrates the learned results. We proved that the scaling up neural network is equivalent to a neural network which adds a penalty term to the error function for controlling the bias and variance. The algorithm was evaluated using the large dataset from UCI repository.

AB In addition to intrusion prevention, intrusion detection is a critical process for network security. The task of intrusion detection is to identify a network connecting record as representing a normal or abnormal behavior. This is a classification problem that can be addressed using machine learning techniques. Commonly used techniques include supervised learning such as Support Vector Machine classification (SVM) and unsupervised learning such as Clustering with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). In this paper, we described a new approach that combines SVM and ACO to take advantages of both approaches while overcome their drawbacks. We called the new method Combining Support Vectors with Ant Colony (CSVAC). Our experimental results on a benchmark data set show that the new approach was better than or at least comparable with pure SVM and pure ACO on the performance measures.

Research in this area mainly focuses to improve the detection method in network traffic flow. Machine learning techniques had been widely used to analyze large datasets including network traffic. In order to develop a sound mechanism for NIDS detection tool, benchmark datasets is required to assist the data mining process. This paper presents the benchmark datasets available publicly for NIDS study such as KDDCup99, IES, pcapr and others. We use some popular machine learning tools to visualize the properties and characteristics of the benchmark datasets.

AB Scheduling with learning effects has become a popular topic in the past decade; however, most of the research focuses on single-machine problems. In many situations, there are machines in parallel and the skills of workers might be different due to their individual experience. In this paper, we study a uniform parallel machine problem in which the objective is to jointly find an optimal assignment of operators to machines and an optimal schedule to minimize the makespan. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed and computational experiments are conducted to evaluate their performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. An rights reserved.

AB In this paper we consider several single-machine scheduling problems with general learning effects. By general learning effects, we mean that the processing time of a job depends not only on its scheduled position, but also on the total normal processing time of the jobs already processed. We show that the scheduling problems of minimization of the make-span, the total completion time and the sum of the 0th (0 >= 0) power of job completion times can be solved in polynomial time under the proposed models. We also prove that some special cases of the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, we discuss the challenges of sketch recognition accuracy and automation of the Clock Drawing Test (CDT). Sketch recognition in the context of the CDT is a complex problem due to the lack of knowledge of the preference bias among the sketches drawn by neuro-atypical patients. However, machine learning provides a viable solution to detect measurable patterns among sketches drawn in the CDT. The paper posits that these sketches are constrained, and the majority of the recognition work can be completed by doing handwritten digit recognition. All other properties to be measured in the CDT are primarily geometric in nature. The paper explores various machine learning classification techniques for handwritten digit recognition. Finally, based on analysis, we present the best one in context of CDT.

AB Recently, Biskup [2] classifies the learning effect models in scheduling environments into two types: position-based and sum-of-processing-time-based. In this paper, we study scheduling problem with sum-of-logarithm-processing-time-based and position-based learning effects. We show that the single machine scheduling problems to minimize the makespan and the total completion time can both be solved by the smallest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule. We also show that the problems to minimize the maximum lateness, the total weighted completion times and the total tardiness have polynomial-time solutions under agreeable WSFT rule and agreeable EDD rule. In addition, we show that m-machine permutation flowshop problems are still polynomially solvable under the proposed learning model. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Cutting-plane methods are optimization techniques that incrementally construct an approximation of a feasible set or an objective function by linear inequalities called cutting planes. Numerous variants of this basic idea are among standard tools used in convex nonsmooth optimization and integer linear programing. Recently, cutting-plane methods have seen growing interest in the field of machine learning. In this chapter, we describe the basic theory behind these methods and show three of their successful applications to solving machine learning problems: regularized risk minimization, multiple kernel learning, and MAP inference in graphical models.

   Processes; Probabilistic Modelling
AB As interaction methods beyond the static mouse and keyboard setup of the desktop era - such as touch, gesture sensing, and visual tracking - become more common, existing interaction paradigms are no longer good enough. These new modalities have high uncertainty, and conventional interfaces are not designed to reflect this. Research has shown that modelling uncertainty can improve the quality of interaction with these systems. Machine learning offers a rich set of tools to make probabilistic inferences in uncertain systems - this is the focus of my thesis work. In particular, I'm interested in making inferences at the sensor level and propagating uncertainty forward appropriately to applications. In this paper I describe a probabilistic model for touch interaction, and discuss how I intend to use the uncertainty in this model to improve typing accuracy on a soft keyboard. The model described here lays the groundwork for a rich framework for interaction in the presence of uncertainty, incorporating data from multiple sensors to make more accurate inferences about the goals of users, and allowing systems to adapt smoothly and appropriately to their context of use.

DE unconstrained optimization; stochastic optimization; machine learning
AB This paper describes how to incorporate sampled curvature information in a Newton-CG method and in a limited memory quasi-Newton method for statistical learning. The motivation for this work stems from supervised machine learning applications involving a very large number of training points. We follow a batch approach, also known in the stochastic optimization literature as a sample average approximation approach. Curvature information is incorporated in two subsampled Hessian algorithms, one based on a matrix-free inexact Newton iteration and one on a preconditioned limited memory BFGS iteration. A crucial feature of our technique is that Hessian-vector multiplications are carried out with a significantly smaller sample size than is used for the function and gradient. The efficiency of the proposed methods is illustrated using a machine learning application involving speech recognition.

AB Objective: We consider predictive models for clinical performance of pancreatic cancer patients based on machine learning techniques. The predictive performance of machine learning is compared with that of the linear and logistic regression techniques that dominate the medical oncology literature.
   Methods and materials: We construct predictive models over a clinical database that we have developed for the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA. The database contains retrospective records of 91 patient treatments for pancreatic tumors. Classification and regression targets include patient survival time, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) quality of life scores, surgical outcomes, and tumor characteristics. The predictive performance of several techniques is described, and specific models are presented.
   Results: We show that machine learning techniques attain a predictive performance that is as good as, or better than, that of linear and logistic regression, for target attributes that include tumor N and T stage, survival time, and ECOG quality of life scores. Bayesian techniques are found to provide the best performance overall. For tumor size as the target attribute, however, logistic regression (respectively linear regression in the case of a numerical as opposed to discrete target) performs best. Preprocessing in the form of attribute selection and supervised attribute discretization improves predictive performance for most of the predictive techniques and target attributes considered.
   Conclusion: Machine learning provides techniques for improved prediction of clinical performance. These techniques therefore merit consideration as valuable alternatives to traditional multivariate regression techniques in clinical medical studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An Electrocardiogram or ECG is an electrical recording of the heart and is used in the investigation of heart disease. This ECG can be classified as normal and abnormal signals. The classification of the ECG signals is presently performed with the support vector machine. The generalization performance of the SVM classifier is not sufficient for the correct classification of ECG signals. To overcome this problem, the ELM classifier is used which works by searching for the best value of the parameters that tune its discriminant function and upstream by looking for the best subset of features that feed the classifier. The experiments were conducted on the ECG data from the Physionet arrhythmia database to classify five kinds of abnormal waveforms and normal beats. In this paper, a thorough experimental study was done to show the superiority of the generalization capability of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) that is presented and compared with support vector machine (SVM) approach in the automatic classification of ECG beats. In particular, the sensitivity of the ELM classifier is tested and that is compared with SVM combined with two classifiers, and they are the k-nearest Neighbor Classifier and the radial basis function neural network classifier, with respect to the curse of dimensionality and the number of available training beats. The obtained results clearly confirm the superiority of the ELM approach as compared with traditional classifiers.

AB We propose a support-vector-machine (SVM) tree to hierarchically learn from domain knowledge represented by low-level features toward automatic classification of sports videos. The proposed SVM tree adopts a binary tree structure to exploit the nature of SVM's binary classification, where each internal node is a single SVM learning unit, and each external node represents the classified output type. Such a SVM tree presents a number of advantages, which include: 1. low computing cost; 2. integrated learning and classification while preserving individual SVM's learning strength; and 3. flexibility in both structure and learning modules, where different numbers of nodes and features can be added to address specific learning requirements, and various learning models can be added as individual nodes, such as neural networks, AdaBoost, hidden Markov models, dynamic Bayesian networks, etc. Experiments support that the proposed SVM tree achieves good performances in sports video classifications.

AB In this paper, a fast optimization algorithm was proposed to learn the Non-Convex Linear Support Vector Machines (LSVM-NC) based on stochastic optimization, in which the non-convex function, Ramp Loss, was used to suppress the influence of noisy data in the case of large-scale learning problems. As for solving the non-convex linear SVMs, the traditional methods make use of the ConCave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) based on the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm from dual, which is a time-consuming process and impractical for learning large-scale problems. To tackle this, we resorted to CCCP based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm from primal, and experimental results proved that our method could reduce the training time largely and improve the generalization performance.

AB A lack of reliable observations for canopy science research is being partly overcome by the gradual use of lidar remote sensing. This study aims to improve lidar-based canopy characterization with airborne laser scanners through the combined use of lidar composite metrics and machine learning models. Our so-called composite metrics comprise a relatively large number of lidar predictors that tend to retain as much information as possible when reducing raw lidar point clouds into a format suitable as inputs to predictive models of canopy structural variables. The information-rich property of such composite metrics is further complemented by machine learning, which offers an array of supervised learning models capable of relating canopy characteristics to high-dimensional lidar metrics via complex, potentially nonlinear functional relationships. Using coincident lidar and field data over an Eastern Texas forest in USA, we conducted a case study to demonstrate the ubiquitous power of the lidar composite metrics in predicting multiple forest attributes and also illustrated the use of two kernel machines, namely, support vector machine and Gaussian processes (GP). Results show that the two machine learning models in conjunction with the lidar composite metrics outperformed traditional approaches such as the maximum likelihood classifier and linear regression models. For example, the five-fold cross validation for GP regression models (vs. linear/log-linear models) yielded a root mean squared error of 1.06 (2.36) m for Lorey's height, 0.95 (3.43) m for dominant height, 534 (8.51) m(2)/ha for basal area, 21.4 (40.5) Mg/ha for aboveground biomass, 654 (9.88) Mg/ha for belowground biomass, 0.75 (2.76) m for canopy base height, 2.2 (2.76) m for canopy ceiling height, 0.015 (0.02) kg/m(3) for canopy bulk density, 0.068 (0.133) kg/m(2) for available canopy fuel, and 033 (0.39) m(2)/m(2) for leaf area index. Moreover, uncertainty estimates from the GP regression were more indicative of the true errors in the predicted canopy variables than those from their linear counterparts. With the ever-increasing accessibility of multisource remote sensing data, we envision a concomitant expansion in the use of advanced statistical methods, such as machine learning, to explore the potentially complex relationships between canopy characteristics and remotely-sensed predictors, accompanied by a desideratum for improved error analysis.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the most popular and important learning algorithms. It comes from single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks. It has been proved that ELM can achieve better performance than support vector machine (SVM) in regression and classification. In this paper, mathematically, with regression problem, the step 3 of ELM is studied. First of all, the equation H beta=T are reformulated as an optimal model. With the optimality, the necessary conditions of optimal solution are presented. The equation H beta=T is replaced by (HH)-H-T beta= (HT)-T-T. We can prove that the latter must have one solution at least. Second, optimal approximation solution is discussed in cases of H is column full rank, row full rank, neither column nor row full rank. In the last case, the rank-1 and rank-2 methods are used to get optimal approximation solution. In theory, this paper present a better algorithm for ELM. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we consider the single machine scheduling problems with time-dependent deterioration and exponential learning effect, i.e., the actual processing time of a job depends not only on the processing times of the jobs already processed but also on its scheduled position. We consider the following objective functions: the makespan, the sum of the delta th (delta >= 0) power of job completion times, the total weighted completion time and the maximum lateness. We show that the makespan minimization problem, the sum of the delta th power of job completion times minimization problem can be solved by the smallest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule, respectively. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions.

AB Knowing which workflows were executed within Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) is essential for successful IT management. In many cases, SOAs are grown from existing IT architectures, and existing components are used as single services thereby forming parts of newly created workflows. Since such workflows consist also of newly developed and of legacy services, traditional workflow management systems often cannot be applied. This paper presents a method for gathering information about the executed workflows within such heterogeneous environments. An implementation of a framework is presented. This framework allows machine-learning algorithms to be trained with workflow models, and low-level monitoring information such as those produced by log4J can be mapped back to appropriate workflows. The results of the machine-learning algorithms used are compared simulating different scenarios and their relevance for production use is evaluated. The method presented provides the basis for successful IT management within heterogeneous SOAs.

DE MPI runtime parameters; tuning; machine learning
AB MPI implementations provide several hundred runtime parameters that can be tuned for performance improvement. The ideal parameter setting does not only depend on the target multiprocessor architecture but also on the application, its problem and communicator size.
   This paper presents ATune, an automatic performance tuning tool that uses machine learning techniques to determine the program-specific optimal settings for a subset of the Open MPI's runtime parameters. ATune learns the behaviour of a target system by means of a training phase where several MPI benchmarks and MPI applications are run on a target architecture for varying problem and communicator sizes. For new input programs, only one run is required in order for ATune to deliver a prediction of the optimal runtime parameters values.
   Experiments based on the NAS Parallel Benchmarks performed on a cluster of SMP machines are shown that demonstrate the effectiveness of ATune. For these experiments, ATune derives MPI runtime parameter settings that are on average within 4% of the maximum performance achievable on the target system resulting in a performance gain of up to 18% with respect to the default parameter setting.

AB Nonlinear dynamical systems, which include models of the Earth's climate, financial markets and complex ecosystems, often undergo abrupt transitions that lead to radically different behavior. The ability to predict such qualitative and potentially disruptive changes is an important problem with far-reaching implications. Even with robust mathematical models, predicting such critical transitions prior to their occurrence is extremely difficult. In this work, we propose a machine learning method to study the parameter space of a complex system, where the dynamics is coarsely characterized using topological invariants. We show that by using a nearest neighbor algorithm to sample the parameter space in a specific manner, we are able to predict with high accuracy the locations of critical transitions in parameter space.

AB Every clustering algorithm requires a similarity measure, ideally optimized for the task in question. In this paper we are concerned with the task of identifying events in social media data and address the question of how a suitable similarity function can be learned from training data for this task. The task consists essentially in grouping social media documents by the event they belong to. In order to learn a similarity measure using machine learning techniques, we extract relevant events from last.fm and match the unique machine tags for these events to pictures uploaded to Flickr, thus getting a gold standard were each picture is assigned to its corresponding event. We evaluate the similarity measure with respect to accuracy on the task of assigning a picture to its correct event. We use SVMs to train an appropriate similarity measure and investigate the performance of different types of SVMs (Ranking SVMs vs. Standard SVMs), different strategies for creating training data as well as the impact of the amount of training data and the kernel used. Our results show that a suitable similarity measure can be learned from a few examples only given a suitable strategy for creating training data. We also show that i) Ranking SVMs can learn from fewer examples, ii) are more robust compared to standard SVMs in the sense that their performance does not vary significantly for different sizes and samples of training data and iii) are not as prone to overfitting as standard SVMs.

We designed an automatic sampling process for leukocyte image according to the staining knowledge of blood smears. In learning stage, ELM classifier is trained online to simulate visual neuron system and then extracts pixels of object from image. The ELM-based segmentation is fully automatic by the proposed framework, which could find efficient samples actively, train the classification model in real time and almost no parameter adjusted. Experimental results demonstrated the new method could extract entire leukocyte from complex scenes, has equivalent performance compared to the SVM-based method and exceeds the marker-controlled watershed algorithm.

AB The ability to timely predict the academic performance tendency of postgraduate students is very important in MSc programs and useful for tutors. The scope of this research is to investigate which is the most efficient machine learning technique in predicting the final grade of Ionian University Informatics postgraduate students. Consequently, five academic courses are chosen, each constituting an individual dataset, and six well-known classification algorithms are experimented with. Furthermore, the datasets are enriched with demographic, in-term performance and in-class behaviour features. The small size of the datasets and the imbalance in the distribution of class values are the main research challenges of the present work. Several techniques, like resampling and feature selection, are employed to address these issues, for the first time in a performance prediction application. Naive Bayes and 1-NN achieved the best prediction results, which are very satisfactory compared to those of similar approaches.

AB In the paper, single machine scheduling problems with a learning effect and a rate-modifying activity are considered. Under the learning effect, the processing time of a job is a decreasing function of its position in the sequence. The rate-modifying activity is an event that can change the speed of the machine, and hence the processing time of jobs after the activity. The following objective functions are considered: the makespan, the total earliness, tardiness and completion time penalty, and the total earliness, tardiness, due-window starting time and due-window size penalty. Polynomial time algorithms are proposed to optimally solve the problems.

AB This work investigates how opera singers manipulate timing in order to produce expressive performances that have common features but also bear a distinguishable personal style. We characterize performances not only relative to the score, but also consider the contribution of features extracted from the libretto. Our approach is based on applying machine learning to extract singer-specific patterns of expressive singing from performances by Josep Carreras and Placido Domingo. We compare and contrast some of these rules, and we draw analogies between them and some of the general expressive performance rules from existing literature.

AB An evolvable artificial cell is a chemical or biological complex system assembled in laboratory. The system is rationally designed to show life-like properties. In order to achieve an optimal design for the emergence of minimal life, a high dimensional space of possible experimental combinations can be explored. A machine learning approach (Evo-DoE) could be applied to explore this experimental space and define optimal interactions according to a specific fitness function. Herein an implementation of an evolutionary design of experiments to optimize chemical and biochemical systems based on a machine learning process is presented. The optimization proceeds over generations of experiments in iterative loop until optimal compositions are discovered. The fitness function is experimentally measured every time the loop is closed. Two examples of complex systems, namely a liposomal drug formulation and an in vitro cell-free expression system are presented as examples of optimization of molecular interactions in high dimensional space of compositions [1,4]. These represent, for instance, the modules or subsystems that could be optimized by "mixing the protocols" to achieve the high level of sophistication that artificial cells requires. In addition a replication cycle of oil in water emulsions is presented. They represent the container for the artificial cells.

ID REDUCTION; FRAMEWORK
AB The presence of fewer samples and large number of input features increases the complexity of the classifier and degrades the stability. Thus, dimension reduction was always carried before supervised learning algorithms such as neural network. This two-stage framework is somewhat redundant in dimension reduction and network training. This paper proposes a novel one-stage learning algorithm for high-dimension small-sample data, called Projection Vector Machine (PVM), which combines dimension reduction with network training and removes the redundancy. Through dimension reduction operation such as singular vector decomposition (SVD), we not only reduce the dimension but also obtain the size of single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) and input weight values simultaneously. This size-fixed network will become linear programming system and thus the output weights can be determined by simple least square method. Unlike traditional backpropagation feedforward neural network (BP), parameters in PVM don't need iterative tuning and thus its training speed is much faster than BP. Unlike extreme learning machine (ELM) proposed by Huang [G.-B. Huang, Q.-Y. Zhu, C.-K. Siew, Extreme learning machine: theory and applications, Neurocomputing 70 (2006) 489-501] which assigns input weights randomly, PVM's input weights are ranked by singular values and select the optimal weights order by singular value. We give proof that PVM is a universal approximator for high-dimension small-sample data. Experimental results show that the proposed one-stage algorithm PVM is faster than two-stage learning approach such as SVD+BP and SVD+ELM.

AB Species' potential distribution modelling consists of building a representation of the fundamental ecological requirements of a species from biotic and abiotic conditions where the species is known to occur. Such models can be valuable tools to understand the biogeography of species and to support the prediction of its presence/absence considering a particular environment scenario. This paper investigates the use of different supervised machine learning techniques to model the potential distribution of 35 plant species from Latin America. Each technique was able to extract a different representation of the relations between the environmental conditions and the distribution profile of the species. The experimental results highlight the good performance of random trees classifiers, indicating this particular technique as a promising candidate for modelling species' potential distribution.

AB Melanoma cancer is one of the most dangerous and potentially deadly types of skin cancer; however, if diagnosed early, it is nearly one-hundred percent curable (UnderstMel09). Here we propose an efficient system which helps with the early diagnosis of melanoma cancer. Different image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms are evaluated to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous moles. Two image feature databases were created: one compiled from a dermatologist-training tool for melanoma from Hosei University and the other created by extracting features from digital pictures of lesions using a software called Skinseg. We then applied various machine learning techniques on the image feature database using a Python-based tool called Orange. The experiments suggest that among the methods tested, the combination of Bayes machine learning with Hosei image feature extraction is the best method for detecting cancerous moles. Then, using this method, a computer tool was developed to return the probability that an image is cancerous. This is a very practical application as it allows for at-home findings of the probability that a mole is cancerous. This does not replace visits to a doctor, but provides early information that allows people to be proactive in the diagnosis of melanoma cancer.

AB Despite the popularity of lexicalized parsing models, practical concerns such as data sparseness and applicability to domains of different vocabularies make unlexicalized models that do not refer to word tokens themselves deserve more attention. A classifier-based parser using an unlexicalized parsing model has been developed. Most importantly, to enhance the accuracy of these tasks, we investigated the notion of distituency (the possibility that two parts of speech cannot remain in the same constituent or phrase) and incorporated it as attributes using various statistic measures. A machine learning method integrates linguistic attributes and information-theoretic attributes in two tasks, namely sentence chunking and phrase recognition. The parser was applied to parsing English and Chinese sentences in the Penn Treebank and the Tsinghua Chinese Treebank. It achieved a parsing performance of F-Score 80.3% in English and 82.4% in Chinese.

AB Machine learning techniques have recently been applied to the problem of lithographic hotspot detection. It is widely believed that they are capable of identifying hotspot patterns unknown to the trained model. The quality of a machine learning method is conventionally measured by the accuracy rates determined from experiments employing random partitioning of benchmark samples into training and testing sets. In this paper, we demonstrate that these accuracy rates may not reflect the predictive capability of a method. We introduce two metrics-the predictive and memorizing accuracy rates-that quantitatively characterize the method's capability to capture hotspots. We also claim that the number of false alarms per detected hotspot reflects both the method's performance and the difficulty of detecting hotspots in the test set. By adopting the proposed metrics, a designer can conduct a fair comparison between different hotspot detection tools and adopt the one better suited to the verification needs.

   Scalability; Machine Learning
AB Nowadays, networks and terminals with diverse characteristics of bandwidth and capabilities coexist. To ensure a good quality of experience, this diverse environment demands adaptability of the video stream. In general, video contents are compressed to save storage capacity and to reduce the bandwidth required for its transmission. Therefore, if these compressed video streams were compressed using scalable video coding schemes, they would be able to adapt to those heterogeneous networks and a wide range of terminals. Since the majority of the multimedia contents are compressed using H.264/AVC, they cannot benefit from that scalability. This paper proposes a technique to convert an H.264/AVC bitstream without scalability to a scalable bitstream with temporal scalability in Main Profile by accelerating the mode decision task of the SVC encoding stage using Machine Learning tools. The results show that when our technique is applied, the complexity is reduced by 87% while maintaining coding efficiency.

AB For solving the problem that extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm uses fixed activation function and cannot be residual compensation, a new learning algorithm called variable activation function extreme learning machine based on residual prediction compensation is proposed. In the learning process, the proposed method adjusts the steep degree, position and mapping scope simultaneously. To enhance the nonlinear mapping capability of ELM, particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize variable parameters according to root-mean square error for the prediction accuracy of the mode. For further improving the predictive accuracy, the auto-regressive moving average model is used to model the residual errors between actual value and predicting value of variable activation function extreme learning machine (V-ELM). The prediction of residual errors is used to rectify the prediction value of V-ELM. Simulation results verified the effectiveness and feasibility of this method by using Pole, Auto-Mpg, Housing, Diabetes, Triazines and Stock benchmark datasets. Also, it was implemented to develop a soft sensor model for the gasoline dry point in delayed coking and some satisfied results were obtained.

AB A lightweight and secure key storage scheme using silicon Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) is described. To derive stable PUF bits from chip manufacturing variations, a lightweight error correction code (ECC) encoder / decoder is used. With a register count of 69, this codec core does not use any traditional error correction techniques and is 75% smaller than a previous provably secure implementation, and yet achieves robust environmental performance in 65nm FPGA and 0.13 mu ASIC implementations. The security of the syndrome bits uses a new security argument that relies on what cannot be learned from a machine learning perspective. The number of Leaked Bits is determined for each Syndrome Word, reducible using Syndrome Distribution Shaping. The design is secure from a min-entropy standpoint against a machine-learning-equipped adversary that, given a ceiling of leaked bits, has a classification error bounded by epsilon. Numerical examples are given using latest machine learning results.

AB In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel framework of reversible watermarking. This work is based on the difference-image histogram shift. De-correlation is the core of high capacity data-hiding in histogram-shift techniques. For the sake of higher payload, we choose the down-sample pattern as reference set. For each layer, prediction points are obtained in terms of points from the reference set. The full-resolution image quality reconstructed determines to reversible watermarking performance. When existing the prior knowledge, an effective regression method named extreme learning machine is utilized to estimate missing pixels. It can yield high-quality recovery image. Compared to other better algorithms on state of the art, the proposed method achieves higher capacity gain of watermarked images with the similar distortion. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a new design heuristic for hybrid classifier ensembles in machine learning. The heuristic entails inclusion of both global and local learners in the composition of base classifiers of a hybrid classifier ensemble, while also inducing both heterogeneous and homogenous diversity through the co-existence of global and local learners. Realization of the proposed heuristic is demonstrated within a hybrid ensemble classifier framework. The utility of proposed heuristic for enhancing the hybrid classifier ensemble performance is assessed and evaluated through a simulation study. Weka machine learning tool bench along with 46 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository are used. Simulation results indicate that the proposed heuristic enhances the performance of a hybrid classification ensemble.

AB Studies have shown that interactions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may play an important role in understanding the causes of complex disease. We have proposed an integrated machine learning method that combines two machine-learning methodsRandom Forests (RF) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)to identify a subset of important SNPs and detect interaction patterns more effectively and efficiently. In this two-stage RF-MARS (TRM) approach, RF is first applied to detect a predictive subset of SNPs, and then MARS is used to identify the interaction patterns. We evaluated the TRM performances in four models. RF variable selection was based on out-of-bag classification error rate (OOB) and variable important spectrum (IS). Our results support that RFOOB had better performance than MARS and RFIS in detecting important variables. This study demonstrates that TRMOOB, which is RFOOB plus MARS, has combined the strengths of RF and MARS in identifying SNP-SNP interactions in a scenario of 100 candidate SNPs. TRMOOB had greater true positive rate and lower false positive rate compared with MARS, particularly for searching interactions with a strong association with the outcome. Therefore, the use of TRMOOB is favored for exploring SNP-SNP interactions in a large-scale genetic variation study.

AB In HCI researches, human emotion classification has done by machine learning algorithms based on physiological signals. The aim of this study is to classify three different emotional states (boredom, pain, and surprise) by 5 machine teaming algorithms using features extracted from physiological signals. 200 college students participated in this experiment The audio-visual film clips Were used to provoke emotions and were tested their appropriateness and effectiveness. EDA ECG.. PPG, and SKT as physiological signals,, were acquired for 1 minute before each emotional state as baseline and for 1-1.5 minutes timing emotional state and were analyzed for 30 seconds from the baseline and the emotional stitte. 23 parameters were extracted from these signals: SCL NSCR, mean SCR, mean SET, maxinmm SET, sum of negative SET, and sum of positive SET, mean FPG, mean RR interval. standard deviation RR interval, mean BPM, RMSSD, NN50, percenet of NN50, SD1, SD2, CSI, CVI, IF HF nLF nHF, and LF/HF ratio. For emotion classification, the difference values of each feature subtracting baseline from the emotional state were used I or analysis using 5 machine learning algorithms. The result showed that an accuracy of emotion classification by SOM was lowest and SVM was highest. This could help emotion recognition studies lead to better chance to recognize various human emotions by using physiological signals. Also, it is able to be applied on human-computer interaction system for emotion detection.

AB We have developed a platform for exposing high school students to machine learning techniques for signal processing problems, making use of relatively simple mathematics and engineering concepts. Along with this platform we have created two example scenarios which give motivation to the students for learning the theory underlying their solutions. The first scenario features a recycling sorting problem in which the students must setup a system so that the computer may learn the different types of objects to recycle so that it may automatically place them in the proper receptacle. The second scenario was motivated by a high school biology curriculum. The students are to develop a system that learns the different types of bacteria present in a pond sample. The system will then group the bacteria together based on similarity. One of the key strengths of this platform is that virtually any type of scenario may be built upon the concepts conveyed in this paper. This then permits student participation from a wide variety of educational motivation.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely applied in electricity price forecasts due to their nonlinear modeling capabilities. However, it is well known that in general, traditional training methods for ANNs such as back-propagation (BP) approach are normally slow and it could be trapped into local optima. In this paper, a fast electricity market price forecast method is proposed based on a recently emerged learning method for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks, the extreme learning machine (ELM), to overcome these drawbacks. The new approach also has improved price intervals forecast accuracy by incorporating bootstrapping method for uncertainty estimations. Case studies based on chaos time series and Australian National Electricity Market price series show that the proposed method can effectively capture the nonlinearity from the highly volatile price data series with much less computation time compared with other methods. The results show the great potential of this proposed approach for online accurate price forecasting for the spot market prices analysis.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Support vector machines (SVMs) is a popular machine learning technique, which works effectively with balanced datasets. However, when it comes to imbalanced datasets, SVMs produce suboptimal classification models. On the other hand, the SVM algorithm is sensitive to outliers and noise present in the datasets. Therefore, although the existing class imbalance learning (CIL) methods can make SVMs less sensitive to class imbalance, they can still suffer from the problem of outliers and noise. Fuzzy SVMs (FSVMs) is a variant of the SVM algorithm, which has been proposed to handle the problem of outliers and noise. In FSVMs, training examples are assigned different fuzzy-membership values based on their importance, and these membership values are incorporated into the SVM learning algorithm to make it less sensitive to outliers and noise. However, like the normal SVM algorithm, FSVMs can also suffer from the problem of class imbalance. In this paper, we present a method to improve FSVMs for CIL (called FSVM-CIL), which can be used to handle the class imbalance problem in the presence of outliers and noise. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed FSVM-CIL method on ten real-world imbalanced datasets and compared its performance with five existing CIL methods, which are available for normal SVM training. Based on the overall results, we can conclude that the proposed FSVM-CIL method is a very effective method for CIL, especially in the presence of outliers and noise in datasets.

AB Lee and Wu [3] introduce a scheduling model in which the job processing times are affected by both position-based and sum-of-processing-time-based learning effects simultaneously. We demonstrate by a counter-example that their main results are incorrect. We provide a revised model of the general learning effect and show that some single-machine scheduling problems are polynomially solvable under the revised model. We also show that some special cases of flowshop scheduling can be solved in polynomial time under the revised model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the paper we present some guidelines for the application of nonparametric statistical tests and post-hoc procedures devised to perform multiple comparisons of machine learning algorithms. We emphasize that it is necessary to distinguish between pairwise and multiple comparison tests. We show that the pairwise Wilcoxon test, when employed to multiple comparisons, will lead to overoptimistic conclusions. We carry out intensive normality examination employing ten different tests showing that the output of machine learning algorithms for regression problems does not satisfy normality requirements. We conduct experiments on nonparametric statistical tests and post-hoc procedures designed for multiple 1 x N and N x N comparisons with six different neural regression algorithms over 29 benchmark regression data sets. Our investigation proves the usefulness and strength of multiple comparison statistical procedures to analyse and select machine learning algorithms.

   with prior knowledge; Multi-task learning; Semantic-based regularization
AB We propose a general framework to incorporate first-order logic (FOL) clauses, that are thought of as an abstract and partial representation of the environment, into kernel machines that learn within a semi-supervised scheme. We rely on a multi-task learning scheme where each task is associated with a unary predicate defined on the feature space, while higher level abstract representations consist of FOL clauses made of those predicates. We re-use the kernel machine mathematical apparatus to solve the problem as primal optimization of a function composed of the loss on the supervised examples, the regularization term, and a penalty term deriving from forcing real-valued constraints deriving from the predicates. Unlike for classic kernel machines, however, depending on the logic clauses, the overall function to be optimized is not convex anymore. An important contribution is to show that while tackling the optimization by classic numerical schemes is likely to be hopeless, a stage-based learning scheme, in which we start learning the supervised examples until convergence is reached, and then continue by forcing the logic clauses is a viable direction to attack the problem. Some promising experimental results are given on artificial learning tasks and on the automatic tagging of bibtex entries to emphasize the comparison with plain kernel machines.

AB The problem of learning by examples in ultrametric committee machines (UCMs) is studied within the framework of statistical mechanics. Using the replica formalism we calculate the average generalization error in UCMs with L hidden layers and for a large enough number of units. In most of the regimes studied we find that the generalization error, as a function of the number of examples presented, develops a discontinuous drop at a critical value of the load parameter. We also find that when L > 1 a number of teacher networks with the same number of hidden layers and different overlaps induce learning processes with the same critical points.

AB Moving detection is a hot research area. Order to detect flexible and improve the detection accuracy, we propose a scene-adaptive moving detection model with machine learning based on clustering. The model uses a group of testing images to train the camera firstly, which means we can get out accurate parameters for one scene. We design a detection algorithm that used in training process based on clustering. Then it uses the parameters and detection algorithm to detect the changes in monitor scene. The experience shows our model has a high adaptability and accuracy.

ELM randomly chooses hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. A detailed analysis of different activation functions with varying number of hidden neurons is carried out using Stat log-Heart dataset. The evaluation results indicate that ELM produces better classification accuracy with reduced training time. Its performance has been compared with other methods such as the Naive Bayes, AWAIS, C4.5, and Logistic Regression algorithms sited in the previous literature.

AB In the current study, computational models for hPXR activators and hPXR non-activators were developed using support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithms. 73 molecular descriptors used for hPXR activator and hPXR non-activator prediction were selected from a pool of 548 descriptors by using a multi-step hybrid feature selection method combining Fischer's score and Monte Carlo simulated annealing method. The y-scrambling method was used to test if there is a chance correlation in the developed SVM model. In the meantime, five-fold cross validation of these machine learning methods results in the prediction accuracies of 87.2-92.5% for hPXR activators and 73.8-87.8% for hPXR non-activators, and the prediction accuracies for external test set are 93.8-95.8% for hPXR activators and 86.7-92.8% for hPXR non-activators. Our study suggested that the tested machine learning methods are potentially useful for hPXR activators identification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ENERGY MANAGEMENT AGENT
AB In this series of two papers, we present our research on intelligent energy management for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). These two papers cover the modeling of power flow in HEVs, the mathematical background of optimization in energy management in HEVs, a machine learning framework that combines dynamic programming (DP) with machine learning to learn about roadway-type-and traffic-congestion-level-specific energy optimization, machine learning algorithms, and real-time quasi-optimal control of energy flow in an HEV. This first paper presents our research on machine learning for optimal energy management in HEVs. We will present a machine learning framework ML_EMO_HEV developed for the optimization of energy management in an HEV, machine learning algorithms for predicting driving environments, and the generation of an optimal power split for a given driving environment. Experiments are conducted based on a simulated Ford Escape Hybrid vehicle model provided by Argonne National Laboratory's Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). Based on the experimental results on the test data, we can conclude that the neural networks trained under the ML_EMO_HEV framework are effective in predicting roadway type and traffic congestion levels, predicting driving trends, and learning optimal engine speed and optimal battery power from DP.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneous determination of optimal due dates and optimal schedule for the single machine problem with multiple common due dates. The penalty for a job is assumed to be a linear function of the due date and the earliness/tardiness for the job. The objective function is to minimize the total penalty for all jobs. We show that with the introduction of learning to job processing times the problem remains polynomially solvable for a given number of multiple common due dates. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper proposes two approaches based on wavelet transform-support vector machine (WT-SVM) and wavelet transform-extreme learning machine (WT-ELM) for transmission line protection. These methods uses fault current samples for half cycle from the inception of fault. The features of the line currents are extracted by first level decomposition of the current samples using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and extracted features are applied as inputs to SVM and ELM for faulted phase detection, fault classification, location and discrimination between fault and switching transient condition. The feasibility of the proposed methods have been tested on a 240-kV, 225-km transmission line for all the 10 types of fault using MATLAB Simulink. Upon testing on 9600 fault cases with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, pre-fault power level, and source impedances, the performance of the proposed methods are quite promising. The performance of the proposed methods is compared in terms of classification accuracy and fault location error. The results indicate that SVM based approach is accurate compared to ELM based approach for fault classification. For fault location, the maximum error is less with SVM than ELM and the mean error of SVM is slightly higher than ELM. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A learning controller of nonhonolomic robot in real-time based on support vector machine (SVM) is presented. The controller includes two parts: one is kinematic controller based on nonlinear law, and the other is dynamic controller based on SVM. The kinematic controller is aimed to provide desired velocity which can make the steering system stable. The dynamic controller is aimed to transform the desired velocity to control torque. The parameters of the dynamic system of the robot are estimated through SVM learning algorithm according to the training data of sliding windows in real time. The proposed controller can adapt to the changes in the robot model and uncertainties in the environment. Compared with artificial neural network (ANN) controller, SVM controller can converge to the reference trajectory more quickly and the tracking error is smaller. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the method proposed.

AB Searching for relevant content in a massive amount of multimedia information is facilitated by accurately annotating each image, video, or song with a large number of relevant semantic keywords, or tags. We introduce game-powered machine learning, an integrated approach to annotating multimedia content that combines the effectiveness of human computation, through online games, with the scalability of machine learning. We investigate this framework for labeling music. First, a socially-oriented music annotation game called Herd It collects reliable music annotations based on the "wisdom of the crowds." Second, these annotated examples are used to train a supervised machine learning system. Third, the machine learning system actively directs the annotation games to collect new data that will most benefit future model iterations. Once trained, the system can automatically annotate a corpus of music much larger than what could be labeled using human computation alone. Automatically annotated songs can be retrieved based on their semantic relevance to text-based queries (e.g., "funky jazz with saxophone," "spooky electronica," etc.). Based on the results presented in this paper, we find that actively coupling annotation games with machine learning provides a reliable and scalable approach to making searchable massive amounts of multimedia data.

AB Self-adaptation is a key feature of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Although EAs have been used successfully to solve a wide variety of problems, the performance of this technique depends heavily on the selection of the EA parameters. Moreover, the process of setting such parameters is considered a time-consuming task. Several research works have tried to deal with this problem; however, the construction of algorithms letting the parameters adapt themselves to the problem is a critical and open problem of EAs. This work proposes a novel ensemble machine learning method that is able to learn rules, solve problems in a parallel way and adapt parameters used by its components. A self-adaptive ensemble machine consists of simultaneously working extended classifier systems (XCSs). The proposed ensemble machine may be treated as a meta classifier system. A new self-adaptive XCS-based ensemble machine was compared with two other XCS-based ensembles in relation to one-step binary problems: Multiplexer, One Counts, Hidden Parity, and randomly generated Boolean functions, in a noisy version as well. Results of the experiments have shown the ability of the model to adapt the mutation rate and the tournament size. The results are analyzed in detail.

AB In this paper we introduce a machine learning system based on parallel online regularized least-squares learning algorithm implemented on a network on chip (NoC) hardware architecture. The system is specifically suitable for use in real-time adaptive systems due to the following properties it fulfills. Firstly, the system is able to learn in online fashion, a property required in almost all real-life applications of embedded machine learning systems. Secondly, in order to guarantee real-time response in embedded multi-core computer architectures, the learning system is parallelized and able to operate with a limited amount of computational and memory resources. Thirdly, the system can learn to predict several labels simultaneously which is beneficial, for example, in multi-class and multi-label classification as well as in more general forms of multi-task learning. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm from 1 thread to 4 threads, in a quad-core platform. A Network-on-Chip platform is chosen to implement the algorithm in 16 threads. The NoC consists of a 4x4 mesh. Results show that the system is able to learn with minimal computational requirements, and that the parallelization of the learning process considerably reduces the required processing time.

AB A total of 1559 molecular descriptors including constitutional, charge distribution, topological, geometrical, and physicochemical descriptors were calculated to encode acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The 37 molecular descriptors were selected using a hybrid filter/wrapper approach by combining a Fischer Score and Monte Carlo simulated annealing. Classification models for the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were then built based on support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) methods. For the 515 samples in the training set, we obtained average prediction accuracies of 87.3%-92.7%, 67.0%-81.0%, and 79.4%-88.2% for the positive, the negative, and the total samples, respectively, by 5 - fold cross validation. Average prediction accuracies of 72.7%-82.5%, 41.0%-53.0%, and 62.1%-69.1% were obtained for the positive, the negative, and the total samples, respectively, by the y-scrambling method, indicating that there was no chance correlation in our models. An external test was conducted on 172 samples that were not used for model building and we obtained prediction accuracies of 93.3%-100.0%, 74.6%-89.6%, and 86.1%-95.9% for the positive, the negative, and the total samples, respectively. The prediction accuracies obtained by all the machine learning methods especially by the SVM method were far better than previously reported results.

AB We consider a parallel-machine scheduling problem with a learning effect and the makespan objective. The impact of the learning effect on job processing times is modelled by the general DeJong's learning curve. For this NP-hard problem we propose two exact algorithms: a sequential branch-and-bound algorithm and a parallel branch-and-bound algorithm. We also present the results of experimental evaluation of these algorithms on a computational cluster. Finally, we use the exact algorithms to estimate the performance of two greedy heuristic scheduling algorithms for the problem. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a Bayesian semi-supervised support vector machine (Semi-BSVM) model for binary classification. Our semi-supervised learning has a distinct advantage over supervised or inductive learning since by design it reduces the problem of overfitting. While a traditional support vector machine (SVM) has the widest margin based on the labeled data only, our semi-supervised form of SVM attempts to find the widest margin in both the labeled and unlabeled data space. This enables us to use some information from the unlabeled data and improve the overall prediction performance.
   The likelihood is constructed using a special type of hinge loss function which also involves the unlabeled data. A penalty term is added for the likelihood part constructed from the unlabeled data. The parameters and penalties are controlled through nearly diffuse priors for objectivity of the analysis. The rate of learning from the unlabeled data is reflected through the posterior distribution of the penalty parameter from the unlabeled data. This formulation provides us with a control on how much information should be extracted from the unlabeled data without hurting the overall performance of our model.
   We have applied our model on three simulation data sets and five real life data sets. Our simulation study and real life data analysis show considerable improvement in prediction quality for our semi-supervised learning over supervised learning methods when we have a high learning rate from the unlabeled data. This phenomenon is particularly evident in cases when the amount of unlabeled data is very large compared to the available labeled data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Presented is a multiple model soft sensing method based on extreme learning machine (MELM) algorithm, to solve the problem that single ELM model has lower predictive precision and over-fitting problems. The method adopts Gaussian process to choose secondary variable for soft sensor model. Then, samples data are divided into several groups of data by adaptive affinity propagation clustering, and the sub-models are estimated by ELM regression method. Finally, ELM is regarded as output synthesizer of sub-models. The proposed method has been applied to predict the end point of crude gasoline in delayed coking unit. Compared with single ELM modeling, the simulation results show that the algorithm has better predictive precision and good generalization performance.

AB Music annotation Is an Important research topic in lite multimedia area. One of the challenges in music annotation is how to reduce the human effort in labeling music files for building reliable classification models. In the past there have been many studies on applying support vector machine active learning methods to automatic multimedia data annotation. which try to select the most informative examples for manually Most of these studies focused on selecting a single unlabeled example in. each iteration process for binary classification. As a result, the model has to be retrained after each labeled example is solicited, and the user is likely to lose patience after a few rounds of labeling In this paper. we present a novel multi-class active learning algorithm that can select multiple music examples for labeling m each iteration process. The key of the multi-sample selection for multi-class active learning is how to reduce the redundancy and avoid selecting lite outliers among the selected exampled such that each example provides unique information for model updating To this end, we propose the distance diversity and set density in the support vector machine feature space as lite measurement of the scatter of the selected sample set Experimental results on two music data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method Moreover, although our criterion is designed for music annotation. it can be used in a general frame work.

AB Objective. The purpose of this project was to determine whether machine-learning classifiers could predict which patients would require a preoperative acute pain service (APS) consultation. Design. Retrospective cohort. Setting. University teaching hospital. Subjects. The records of 9,860 surgical patients posted between January 1 and June 30, 2010 were reviewed. Outcome Measures. Request for APS consultation. A cohort of machine-learning classifiers was compared according to its ability or inability to classify surgical cases as requiring a request for a preoperative APS consultation. Classifiers were then optimized utilizing ensemble techniques. Computational efficiency was measured with the central processing unit processing times required for model training. Classifiers were tested using the full feature set, as well as the reduced feature set that was optimized using a merit-based dimensional reduction strategy. Results. Machine-learning classifiers correctly predicted preoperative requests for APS consultations in 92.3% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 91.892.8) of all surgical cases. Bayesian methods yielded the highest area under the receiver operating curve (0.87, 95% CI 0.840.89) and lowest training times (0.0018 seconds, 95% CI, 0.00170.0019 for the NaiveBayesUpdateable algorithm). An ensemble of high-performing machine-learning classifiers did not yield a higher area under the receiver operating curve than its component classifiers. Dimensional reduction decreased the computational requirements for multiple classifiers, but did not adversely affect classification performance. Conclusions. Using historical data, machine-learning classifiers can predict which surgical cases should prompt a preoperative request for an APS consultation. Dimensional reduction improved computational efficiency and preserved predictive performance.

   monitoring
AB A method of weapon detection for the Comprehensive nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty (CTBT) consists of monitoring the amount of radioxenon in the atmosphere by measuring and sampling the activity concentration of Xe-131m, Xe-133, Xe-133m, and Xe-135 by radionuclide monitoring. Several explosion samples were simulated based on real data since the measured data of this type is quite rare. These data sets consisted of different circumstances of a nuclear explosion, and are used as training data sets to establish an effective classification model employing state-of-the-art technologies in machine learning. A study was conducted involving classic induction algorithms in machine learning including Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines, that revealed that they can successfully be used in this practical application. In particular, our studies show that many induction algorithms in machine learning outperform a simple linear discriminator when a signal is found in a high radioxenon background environment.

In this model, the processing times of jobs are defined as functions of their starting times and positions in a sequence. For the following two objective functions: the weighted sum of completion times and the maximum lateness, this paper proposes two heuristics according to the corresponding single machine problems without learning effect. This paper also gives the worst-case error bound for the heuristics and provides computational results to evaluate the performance of the heuristics.

AB Scheduling with learning effects has received a lot of research attention lately. However, the flowshop setting is relatively unexplored. On the other hand, the actual processing time of a job under an uncontrolled learning effect will drop to zero precipitously as the number of jobs increases. This is rather absurd in reality. Motivated by these observations, we consider a two-machine flowshop scheduling problem in which the actual processing time of a job in a schedule is a function of the job's position in the schedule and a control parameter of the learning function. The objective is to minimize the total completion time. We develop a branch-and-bound and three simulated annealing algorithms to solve the problem. Computational results show that the proposed algorithms are efficient in producing near-optimal solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To solve the problem of extreme learning machine (ELM) on-line training with sequential training samples, a new algorithm called selective forgetting extreme learning machine (SF-ELM) is proposed and applied to chaotic time series prediction. The SF-ELM adopts the latest training sample and weights the old training samples iteratively to insure that the influence of the old training samples is weakened. The output weight of the SF-ELM is determined recursively during on-line training procedure according to its generalization performance. Numerical experiments on chaotic time series on-line prediction indicate that the SF-ELM is an effective on-line training version of ELM. In comparison with on-line sequential extreme learning machine, the SF-ELM has better performance in the sense of computational cost and prediction accuracy.

AB This study's primary objective lies in short-term forecasting of where and when hypoxia may transpire to enable observing its effects in real time, focusing on a case study in Corpus Christi Bay (Texas). Dissolved oxygen levels in this bay can be characterized by three temporal trends (daily, seasonal, and long-term). To predict hypoxic events, these three mathematical trends are isolated and extracted to obtain unbiased forecasts using a sequential normalization approach. Next, machine learning algorithms are constructed employing the continuous, normalized values from a variety of sensor locations. By including latitude and longitude coordinates as additional variables, a spatial depiction of hypoxic conditions can be illustrated effectively, allowing for more efficient summer data collection and more accurate, near-real-time projections. Using k-nearest neighbor and regression tree algorithms, approximate probabilities of observing hypoxia the following day were calculated, and estimates of dissolved oxygen levels were also computed. During periods in which hypoxia was observed, forecast probabilities of hypoxia exceeded 80%. Conversely, during periods in which no hypoxia was observed, the model's estimate remained below 20%. These results indicate that the modeling approach produces reasonable forecasts for this case study.

AB Traffic signs are characterized by a wide variability in their visual appearance in real-world environments. For example, changes of illumination, varying weather conditions and partial occlusions impact the perception of road signs. In practice, a large number of different sign classes needs to be recognized with very high accuracy. Traffic signs have been designed to be easily readable for humans, who perform very well at this task. For computer systems, however, classifying traffic signs still seems to pose a challenging pattern recognition problem. Both image processing and machine learning algorithms are continuously refined to improve on this task. But little systematic comparison of such systems exist. What is the status quo? Do today's algorithms reach human performance? For assessing the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we present a publicly available traffic sign dataset with more than 50,000 images of German road signs in 43 classes. The data was considered in the second stage of the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark held at IJCNN 2011. The results of this competition are reported and the best-performing algorithms are briefly described. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) showed particularly high classification accuracies in the competition. We measured the performance of human subjects on the same data-and the CNNs outperformed the human test persons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Kernel machines; Learning from constraints; Support vector machines
AB The significant evolution of kernel machines in the last few years has opened the doors to a truly new wave in machine learning on both the theoretical and the applicative side. However, in spite of their strong results in low level learning tasks, there is still a gap with models rooted in logic and probability, whenever one needs to express relations and express constraints amongst different entities. This paper describes how kernel-like models, inspired by the parsimony principle, can cope with highly structured and rich environments that are described by the unified notion of constraint. We formulate the learning as a constrained variational problem and prove that an approximate solution can be given by a kernel-based machine, referred to as a support constraint machine (SCM), that makes it possible to deal with learning tasks (functions) and constraints. The learning process resembles somehow the unification of Prolog, since the learned functions yield the verification of the given constraints. Experimental evidence is given of the capability of SCMs to check new constraints in the case of first-order logic.

AB It is clear that the learning effectiveness and learning speed of neural networks are in general far slower than required, which has been a major bottleneck for many applications. Recently, a simple and efficient learning method, referred to as extreme learning machine (ELM), was proposed by Huang et al., which has shown that, compared to some conventional methods, the training time of neural networks can be reduced by a thousand times. However, one of the open problems in ELM research is whether the number of hidden nodes can be further reduced without affecting learning effectiveness. This brief proposes a new learning algorithm, called bidirectional extreme learning machine (B-ELM), in which some hidden nodes are not randomly selected. In theory, this algorithm tends to reduce network output error to 0 at an extremely early learning stage. Furthermore, we find a relationship between the network output error and the network output weights in the proposed B-ELM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can be tens to hundreds of times faster than other incremental ELM algorithms.

AB The goal of the Machine Learning and Traveling Repairman Problem (ML&TRP) is to determine a route for a "repair crew," which repairs nodes on a graph. The repair crew aims to minimize the cost of failures at the nodes, but the failure probabilities are not known and must be estimated. If there is uncertainty in the failure probability estimates, we take this uncertainty into account in an unusual way; from the set of acceptable models, we choose the model that has the lowest cost of applying it to the subsequent routing task. In a sense, this procedure agrees with a managerial goal, which is to show that the data can support choosing a low-cost solution.

AB In cooperative multi-robot object transportation several autonomous robots navigate cooperatively in either a static or a dynamic environment to transport an object to a goal location and orientation. The environment may consist of both fixed and movable obstacles and it will be subject to uncertainty and unforeseen changes within the environment. More than one robot may be required for handling heavy and large objects. This paper presents a multi-robot architecture and a machine learning approach for object transportation utilizing multiple cooperative and autonomous mobile robots. A four-layer hierarchical multi-robot architecture is presented, which employs a modified version of Q-learning for effective robot coordination. As needed in the task, the paper also presents an algorithm for object pose estimation using multi-robot coordination mechanism, by utilizing the laser range finder and colour blob tracking. The developed techniques are implemented in a multi-robot system (MRS) in laboratory. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed MRS and its underlying methodologies.

AB Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has become an important drug target and its inhibitors have proved useful in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This work explores several machine learning methods (support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and C4.5 decision tree (C4.5 DT)) for predicting AChE inhibitors (AChEIs). A feature selection method is used for improving prediction accuracy and selecting molecular descriptors responsible for distinguishing AChEIs and non-AChEIs. The prediction accuracies are 76.3% similar to 88.0% for AChEIs and 74.3% similar to 79.6% for non-AChEIs based on the three kinds of machine learning methods. This work suggests that machine learning methods such as SVM are facilitating for predicting AChEIs potential of unknown sets of compounds and for exhibiting the molecular descriptors associated with AChEIs.

AB Tri-training method proposed by Zhou et al., is an excellent method for semi-supervised classification; nevertheless, the heavy computational burden caused by the retraining strategy prevents the further application of tri-training method. To address this problem, this paper proposes the ternary reversible extreme learning machines (TRELM) which is an incremental tri-training method without relying on the retraining strategy. TRELM employs three reversible extreme learning machines (RELM) as its base learners and trains the RELM with extended (or detected) samples in each learning round. RELM is an incremental learning method with reversible derivation capability. RELM can overcome the difficulty for most incremental learning methods in removing the influence of previously learned mistaken samples. Experimental results indicate that TRELM significantly improves the learning speed of tri-training method. In addition, TRELM achieves comparable (or even better) classification performance to other effective semi-supervised learning methods. TRELM is an appropriate choice for semi-supervised classification tasks with large amounts of data sets or with strict demands for learning speed and classification accuracy.

AB In this paper, we consider two single-machine scheduling problems with the effect of deterioration and learning. In this model, the processing times of jobs are defined as functions of their starting times and positions in a sequence. For the following two objective functions, the weighted sum of completion times and the maximum lateness, this paper gives two heuristics according to the corresponding problems without learning effect. This paper also gives the worst-case error bound for the heuristics and provides computational results to evaluate the performance of the heuristics.

AB Statistical methods of automated decision making and modeling have been invented ( and reinvented) in numerous fields for more than a century. Important problems in this arena include pattern classification, regression, control, system identification, and prediction. In recent years, these ideas have come to be recognized as examples of a unified concept known as machine learning, which is concerned with 1) the development of algorithms that quantify relationships within existing data and 2) the use of these identified patterns to make predictions based on new data. Optical character recognition, in which printed characters are identified automatically based on previous examples, is a classic engineering example of machine learning. But this article will discuss very different ways of using machine learning that may be less familiar, and we will demonstrate through examples the role of these concepts in medical imaging.
   Machine learning has seen an explosion of interest in modern computing settings such as business intelligence, detection of e-mail spam, and fraud and credit scoring. The medical imaging field has been slower to adopt modern machine-learning techniques to the degree seen in other fields. However, as computer power has grown, so has interest in employing advanced algorithms to facilitate our use of medical images and to enhance the information we can gain from them.
   Although the term machine learning is relatively recent, the ideas of machine learning have been applied to medical imaging for decades, perhaps most notably in the areas of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and functional brain mapping. We will not attempt in this brief article to survey the rich literature of this field. Instead our goals will be 1) to acquaint the reader with some modern techniques that are now staples of the machine-learning field and 2) to illustrate how these techniques can be employed in various ways in medical imaging using the following examples from our own research:
   CAD
   content-based image retrieval (CBIR)
   automated assessment of image quality
   brain mapping.

AB We address an unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem with R-learning, an average-reward reinforcement learning (RL) method. Different types of jobs dynamically arrive in independent Poisson processes. Thus the arrival time and the due date of each job are stochastic. We convert the scheduling problems into RL problems by constructing elaborate state features, actions, and the reward function. The state features and actions are defined fully utilizing prior domain knowledge. Minimizing the reward per decision time step is equivalent to minimizing the schedule objective, i.e. mean weighted tardiness. We apply an on-line R-learning algorithm with function approximation to solve the RL problems. Computational experiments demonstrate that R-learning learns an optimal or near-optimal policy in a dynamic environment from experience and outperforms four effective heuristic priority rules (i.e. WSPT, WMDD, ATC and WCOVERT) in all test problems.

AB For the importance of communication between human and machine interface, it would be valuable to develop an implement which has the ability to recognize emotional states. In this paper, we proposed an approach which can deal with the daily dependence and personal dependence in the data of multiple subjects and samples. 30 features were extracted from the physiological signals of subject for three states of emotion. The physiological signals measured were: electrocardiogram (ECG), skin temperature (SKT) and galvanic skin response (GSR). After removing the daily dependence and personal dependence by the statistical technique of MANOVA, six machine learning methods including Bayesian network learning, naive Bayesian classification, SVM, decision tree of C4.5, Logistic model and K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) were implemented to differentiate the emotional states. The results showed that Logistic model gives the best classification accuracy and the statistical technique of MANOVA can significantly improve the performance of all six machine learning methods in emotion recognition system.

AB Learning and job deterioration co-exist in many realistic scheduling situations. This paper introduces a general scheduling model with the effects of learning and deterioration simultaneously which is a significant generalization of some existing models in the literature. By the effects of learning and deterioration, we mean that job processing times are defined by functions of their start times and positions in the sequence. This paper shows that the single-machine scheduling problems to minimize the makespan, sum of the kth power of completion times, total lateness and sum of earliness penalties (with a common due date) are polynomially solvable under the proposed model. It further shows that the problems to minimize the total weighted completion time, discounted total weighted completion time, maximum lateness, maximum tardiness, total tardiness and total weighted earliness penalties (with a common due date) are polynomially solvable under certain conditions.

AB Testing the correct model specification hypothesis for artificial neural network (ANN) models of the conditional mean is not standard. The traditional Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and quasi-likelihood ratio statistics weakly converge to functions of Gaussian processes, rather than to convenient chi-squared distributions. Also, their large-sample null distributions are problem dependent, limiting applicability. We overcome this challenge by applying functional regression methods of Cho et al. [8] to extreme learning machines (ELM). The Wald ELM (WELM) test statistic proposed here is easy to compute and has a large-sample standard chi-squared distribution under the null hypothesis of correct specification. We provide associated theory for time-series data and affirm our theory with some Monte Carlo experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurately predicting the binding affinities of large sets of diverse molecules against a range of macromolecular targets is an extremely challenging task. The scoring functions that attempt such computational prediction exploiting structural data are essential for analysing the outputs of Molecular Docking, which is in turn an important technique for drug discovery, chemical biology and structural biology. Conventional scoring functions assume a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the variables that characterise the complex and its predicted binding affinity. The inherent problem of this approach is in the difficulty of explicitly modelling the various contributions of intermolecular interactions to binding affinity.
   Recently, a new family of 3D structure-based regression models for binding affinity prediction has been introduced which circumvent the need for modelling assumptions. These machine learning scoring functions have been shown to widely outperform conventional scoring functions. However, to date no direct comparison among machine learning scoring functions has been made. Here the performance of the two most popular machine learning scoring functions for this task is analysed under exactly the same experimental conditions.

AB Neural network model of aggression can approximate unknown datasets with the less error. As an important method of global regression, extreme learning machine (ELM) represents a typical learning method in single-hidden layer feedforward network, because of the better generalization performance and the faster implementation. The "randomness" property of input weights makes the nonlinear combination reach arbitrary function approximation. In this paper, we attempt to seek the alternative mechanism to input connections. The idea is derived from the evolutionary algorithm. After predefining the number L of hidden nodes, we generate original ELM models. Each hidden node is seemed as a gene. To rank these hidden nodes, the larger weight nodes are reassigned for the updated ELM. We put L/2 trivial hidden nodes in a candidate reservoir. Then, we generate L/2 new hidden nodes to combine L hidden nodes from this candidate reservoir. Another ranking is used to choose these hidden nodes. The fitness-proportional selection may select L/2 hidden nodes and recombine evolutionary selection ELM. The entire algorithm can be applied for large-scale dataset regression. The verification shows that the regression performance is better than the traditional ELM and Bayesian ELM under less cost gain.

AB Emotional e-mail classification is one of the important issues in the service oriented organizations. E-mails are served in a first come first serve basis. Few e-mails express the unfair treatment or dissatisfaction of service. It is essential to serve such e-mails with a high priority. In this paper an attempt is made to identify such mails which express the strong emotions of the customers/stakeholders. This system classifies the e-mails in to three categories via positive, negative and other mails. An adaptive machine learning algorithm that uses combined SVD and KNN methods is developed to solve the problem of emotional e-mail classification. Also an emotional dictionary is used as a central component of this system that serves various emotional words and phrases for classification. The system also adaptive in nature and adapts various new words and phrases that explicates the emotion.

AB Exploring the vast microarchitectural design space of chip multiprocessors (CMPs) through the traditional approach of exhaustive simulations is impractical due to the long simulation times and its super-linear increase with core scaling. Kernel based statistical machine learning algorithms can potentially help predict multiple performance metrics with non-linear dependence on the CMP design parameters. In this paper, we describe and evaluate a machine learning framework that uses Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) to predict the power dissipation and performance of CMPs. Specifically we focus on modeling the microarchitecture of a highly multithreaded CMP targeted towards packet processing. We use a cycle accurate CMP simulator to generate training samples required to build the model. Despite sampling only 0.016% of the design space we observe a median error of 6-10% in the KCCA predicted processor power dissipation and performance.

AB In this paper, we present a new no-reference quality assessment metric for color images by using biologically inspired features (BIFs) and machine learning. In this metric, we first adopt a biologically inspired model to mimic the visual cortex and represent a color image based on BIFs which unifies color units, intensity units and C1 units. Then, in order to reduce the complexity and benefit the classification, the high dimensional features are projected to a low dimensional representation with manifold learning. Finally, a multiclass classification process is performed on this new low dimensional representation of the image and the quality assessment is based on the learned classification result in order to respect the one of the human observers. Instead of computing a final note, our method classifies the quality according to the quality scale recommended by the ITU. The preliminary results show that the developed metric can achieve good quality evaluation performance.

AB A new structure of wavelet neural networks (WNN) with extreme learning machine (ELM) is introduced in this paper. In the proposed wavelet neural networks, composite functions are applied at the hidden nodes and the learning is done using ELM. The input information is first processed by wavelet functions and then passed through a type of bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous activation functions g : R -> R. A selection method that takes into account the domain of input space where the wavelets are not zero is used to initialize the translation and dilation parameters. The formed wavelet neural network is then trained with the computationally efficient ELM algorithm. Experimental results on the regression of some nonlinear functions and real-world data, the prediction of a chaotic signal and classifications on serval benchmark real-world data sets show that the proposed neural networks can achieve better performances in most cases than some relevant neural networks and learn much faster than neural networks training with the traditional back-propagation (BP) algorithm.

AB In this paper a new learning algorithm is proposed for the problem of simultaneous learning of a function and its derivatives as an extension of the study of error minimized extreme learning machine for single hidden layer feedforward neural networks. Our formulation leads to solving a system of linear equations and its solution is obtained by Moore-Penrose generalized pseudo-inverse. In this approach the number of hidden nodes is automatically determined by repeatedly adding new hidden nodes to the network either one by one or group by group and updating the output weights incrementally in an efficient manner until the network output error is less than the given expected learning accuracy. For the verification of the efficiency of the proposed method a number of interesting examples are considered and the results obtained with the proposed method are compared with that of other two popular methods. It is observed that the proposed method is fast and produces similar or better generalization performance on the test data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate and timely traffic classification is critical in network security monitoring and traffic engineering. Traditional methods based on port numbers and protocols have proven to be ineffective in terms of dynamic port allocation and packet encapsulation. The signature matching methods, on the other hand, require a known signature set and processing of packet payload, can only handle the signatures of a limited number of IP packets in real-time. A machine learning method based on SVM (supporting vector machine) is proposed in this paper for accurate Internet traffic classification. The method classifies the Internet traffic into broad application categories according to the network flow parameters obtained from the packet headers. An optimized feature set is obtained via multiple classifier selection methods. Experimental results using traffic from campus backbone show that an accuracy of 99.42% is achieved with the regular biased training and testing samples. An accuracy of 97.17% is achieved when un-biased training and testing samples are used with the same feature set. Furthermore, as all the feature parameters are computable from the packet headers, the proposed method is also applicable to encrypted network traffic.

AB The aim of this study was to use a machine learning approach combining fuzzy modeling with an immune algorithm to model sport training, in particular swimming. A proposed algorithm mines the available data and delivers the results in a form of a set of fuzzy rules "IF (fuzzy conditions) THEN (class)". Fuzzy logic is a powerful method to cope with continuous data, to overcome problem of overlapping class definitions, and to improve the rule comprehensibility. Sport training is modeled at the level of microcycle and training unit by 12 independent attributes. The data was collected in two months (February-March 2008), among swimmers from swimming sections in Wroclaw, Poland. The swimmers had minimum of 7 years of training and reached the II class level in swimming classification from 2005 to 2008. The goal of the performed experiments was to find the rules answering the question - how does the training unit influence swimmer's feelings while being in water the next day? The fuzzy rules were inferred for two different scales of the class to be predicted. The effectiveness of the learned set of rules reached 68.66%. The performance, in terms of classification accuracy, of the proposed approach was compared with traditional classifier schemes. The accuracy of the result of compared methods is significantly lower than the accuracy of fuzzy rules obtained by a method presented in this study (paired t-test, P < 0.05). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Control charts are widely used to identify the potential process problems in modern manufacturing industries, which are shown to be effective in detecting out-of-control signals based upon an overall statistic. But these charts do not relieve the need for pinpointing source(s) of the out-of-control signals, which would be very useful for quality practitioners to locate the assignable causes that give rise to the out-of-control situation. In order to detect out-of-control signals faster and classify abnormal source(s) more accurately, in this paper a learning-based model has been proposed to monitor and diagnose out-of-control signals. In this model, an extreme learning machine approach (ELM) was developed for performing these tasks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the conventional multivariate control scheme in terms of running time, and can accurately classify source(s) of out-of-control signals.

AB Power transformers are one of the most critical equipments in electricity network. A number of techniques such as dissolved gas analysis (DGA), polarization and depolarization currents (PDC) measurement and frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) have been adopted across utilities for transformer insulation diagnosis. However, there are still considerable challenges remaining in interpreting measured data of these techniques. This paper develops machine learning algorithms, which utilise archived data for making insulation diagnosis on the transformer of interest. Analysis and interpretation of field test data are presented in the paper.

AB The exhaustive quality control is becoming very important in the world's globalized market. One of these examples where quality control becomes critical is the percussion cap mass production. These elements must achieve a minimum tolerance deviation in their fabrication. This paper outlines a machine vision development using a 3D camera for the inspection of the whole production of percussion caps. This system presents multiple problems, such as metallic reflections in the percussion caps, high speed movement of the system and mechanical errors and irregularities in percussion cap placement. Due to these problems, it is impossible to solve the problem by traditional image processing methods, and hence, machine learning algorithms have been tested to provide a feasible classification of the possible errors present in the percussion caps.

AB Closed-loop operation of a brain-machine interface (BMI) relies on the subject's ability to learn an inverse transformation of the plant to be controlled. In this paper, we propose a model of the learning process that undergoes closed-loop BMI operation. We first explore the properties of the model and show that it is able to learn an inverse model of the controlled plant. Then, we compare the model predictions to actual experimental neural and behavioral data from nonhuman primates operating a BMI, which demonstrate high accordance of the model with the experimental data. Applying tools from control theory to this learning model will help in the design of a new generation of neural information decoders which will maximize learning speed for BMI users.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a recently popular learning algorithm for the easy of accomplishment, low computational cost and high generalization performance. A binary classification method, called Probabilistic Extreme Learning Machine (PELM), is proposed to enhance the reliability of classification. It uses available prior knowledge, probability density function and Bayes rules to classify the unknown samples to avoid the misclassification due to the uncertainty of ELM predictions. Parameters of probability density function are estimated by nonlinear least squares. The method was tested with the WWTP data. Experimental results show that PELM has a relatively high accuracy compared to ELM.

AB We often use the positive fuzzy rules only for image classification in traditional image classification systems, ignoring the useful negative classification information. Thanh Minh Nguyen and QMJonathan Wu introduced the negative fuzzy rules into the image classification, and proposed combination of positive and negative fuzzy rules to form the positive and negative fuzzy rule system, and then applied it to remote sensing image/natural image classification. Their experiments demonstrated that their proposed method has achieved promising results. However, since their method was realized using the feedforward neural network model which requires adjusting the weights in the gradient descent way, the training speed is very slow. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFNs) learning algorithm, which has distinctive advantages such as quick learning, good generalization performance. In this paper, the equivalence between ELM and the positive and negative fuzzy rule system is revealed, so ELM can be naturally used for training the positive and negative fuzzy rule system quickly for image classification. Our experimental results indicate this claim.

AB The solution for insuring the safety of tele-operated or fully unmanned autonomous systems (UASs) in the air space requires a) that the human remain in and on the loop to the maximal extent practical and b) that the UASs, which share the air space, have an intelligent backend for the processing of their sensory data. Moreover, it is necessary that this sensory processor be capable of generalizing and learning more than it was told in order that it properly handle situations not explicitly programmed for. Given the advent of advances in nanotechnology and microsystems, several research teams continue to investigate the integration of such technologies for single UASs and small swarms of UASs for military, commercial, and civilian applications. Our proposed technology can be readily adapted for transparent learning to serve as an assistant for human piloting as well as an emergency intelligent autopilot for all manner of piloted vehicles.

AB Imagery analysis systems utilize Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) methods in order to improve the accuracy of human-based analysis and save time. Often, ATR methods perform poorly in obtaining these objectives, due to reliance on outdated prior information, while human operators possess updated information that remains unused. This paper presents an interactive target recognition (or ITR) application. The operator marks sample target pixels by an intuitive user-interface. Then machine-learning techniques generate algorithms tailored for their recognition in imagery. The resulting detection map is dynamically controlled by the operator, suiting his needs. The application enables target recognition in zero prior information environments.

AB Machine-learning algorithms are employed in a wide variety of applications to extract useful information from data sets, and many are known to suffer from super-linear increases in computational time with increasing data size and number of signals being processed (data dimension). Certain principal machine-learning algorithms are commonly found embedded in larger detection, estimation, or classification operations. Three such principal algorithms are the Parzen window-based, non-parametric estimation of Probability Density Functions (PDFs), K-means clustering and correlation. Because they form an integral part of numerous machine-learning applications, fast and efficient execution of these algorithms is extremely desirable. FPGA-based reconfigurable computing (RC) has been successfully used to accelerate computationally intensive problems in a wide variety of scientific domains to achieve speedup over traditional software implementations. However, this potential benefit is quite often not fully realized because creating efficient FPGA designs is generally carried out in a laborious, case-specific manner requiring a great amount of redundant time and effort. In this paper, an approach using pattern-based decomposition for algorithm acceleration on FPGAs is proposed that offers significant increases in productivity via design reusability. Using this approach, we design, analyze, and implement a multi-dimensional PDF estimation algorithm using Gaussian kernels on FPGAs. First, the algorithm's amenability to a hardware paradigm and expected speedups are predicted. After implementation, actual speedup and performance metrics are compared to the predictions, showing speedup on the order of 20x over a 3.2 GHz processor. Multi-core architectures are developed to further improve performance by scaling the design. Portability of the hardware design across multiple FPGA platforms is also analyzed. After implementing the PDF algorithm, the value of pattern-based decomposition to support reuse is demonstrated by rapid development of the K-means and correlation algorithms.

AB This paper describes a framework to develop software to monitor and evaluate solar installations using machine-learning models and OPC technology. The proposed framework solves both the problem of monitoring solar installations when there are devices from different manufacturers anti the problem of evaluating solar installations whose operation changes throughout the plant operation period. Moreover, the evaluation programs can be integrated with the monitoring problems. The proposed solution is based on the use of machine-learning models to evaluate the plants and on the use of OPC technology to integrate the monitoring program with the evaluation program. This framework has been used for monitoring and evaluating several real photovoltaic solar plants.

AB We apply relational machine learning techniques to predict antimicrobial activity of peptides. We follow our successful strategy (Szaboova et al., MLSB 2010) to prediction of DNA-binding propensity of proteins from structural features. We exploit structure prediction methods to obtain peptides' spatial structures, then we construct the structural relational features. We use these relational features as attributes in a regression model. We apply this methodology to antimicrobial activity prediction of peptides achieving better predictive accuracies than a state-of-the-art approach.

AB This paper proves the problem of losing incremental samples' information of the present SVM incremental learning algorithm from both theoretic and experimental aspects, and proposes a new incremental learning algorithm with support vector machine based on hyperplane-distance. According to the geometric character of support vector, the algorithm uses Hyperplane-Distance to extract the samples, selects samples which are most likely to become support vector to form the vector set of edge, and conducts the support vector machine training on the vector set. This method reduces the number of training samples and effectively improves training speed of incremental learning. The results of experiment performed on Chinese webpage classification show that this algorithm can reduce the number of training samples effectively and accumulate historical information. The HD-SVM algorithm has higher training speed and better precision of classification.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) has shown to be extremely fast with better generalization performance. However, the implementation of ELM encounters two problems. First; ELM tends to require more hidden nodes than conventional tuning-based algorithms. Second, subjectivity is involved ill choosing hidden nodes number. In this paper, we apply the modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) method to select; hidden nodes which maximize the increment to explained variance of the desired output. The Akaike's final prediction error (FEE) criterion are used to automatically determine the number of hidden nodes. In comparison with conventional ELM learning method on several commonly used regressor benchmark problems. our proposed algorithm can achieve compact network with much faster response and satisfactory accuracy.

AB A global supply chain spans several regions and countries across the globe. A tremendous spurt in the extent of globalization has necessitated the need for modeling global supply chains in place of the conventional supply chains. In this paper, we propose a framework, Eco-Supply, to analyze the supply chain ecosystem in a probabilistic setting unlike the existing methodologies, which presume a deterministic context. EcoSupply keeps track of the previous observations in order to facilitate improved prediction about the influence of uncertainties in the ecosystem, and provides a coherent mathematical exposition to construe the new associations, among the different supply chain stakeholders, in place of the existing links. To the best of our knowledge, EcoSupply is the first machine learning based paradigm to incorporate the dynamics of global supply chains.

AB Hand gesture recognition for human computer interaction is an area of active research in computer vision and machine learning. The primary goal of gesture recognition research is to create a system, which can identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. This paper presents a comparative study of four classification algorithms for static hand gesture classification using two different hand features data sets. The approach used consists in identifying hand pixels in each frame, extract features and use those features to recognize a specific hand pose. The results obtained proved that the ANN had a very good performance and that the feature selection and data preparation is an important phase in the all process, when using low-resolution images like the ones obtained with the camera in the current work.

AB Aim
   Trait-based risk assessment for invasive species is becoming an important tool for identifying non-indigenous species that are likely to cause harm. Despite this, concerns remain that the invasion process is too complex for accurate predictions to be made. Our goal was to test risk assessment performance across a range of taxonomic and geographical scales, at different points in the invasion process, with a range of statistical and machine learning algorithms.
   Location
   Regional to global data sets.
   Methods
   We selected six data sets differing in size, geography and taxonomic scope. For each data set, we created seven risk assessment tools using a range of statistical and machine learning algorithms. Performance of tools was compared to determine the effects of data set size and scale, the algorithm used, and to determine overall performance of the trait-based risk assessment approach.
   Results
   Risk assessment tools with good performance were generated for all data sets. Random forests (RF) and logistic regression (LR) consistently produced tools with high performance. Other algorithms had varied performance. Despite their greater power and flexibility, machine learning algorithms did not systematically outperform statistical algorithms. Geographic scope of the data set, and size of the data set, did not systematically affect risk assessment performance.
   Main conclusions
   Across six representative data sets, we were able to create risk assessment tools with high performance. Additional data sets could be generated for other taxonomic groups and regions, and these could support efforts to prevent the arrival of new invaders. Random forests and LR approaches performed well for all data sets and could be used as a standard approach to risk assessment development.

AB Story card is one of the software development artifacts that can be used to gather requirements in extreme programming (XP). It can assist developers to translate and develop the system based on activities and rules stated in the story card. However, conventional XP story card framework or template is not well defined. It only supports requirements in two or three sentences related to system functionality. This may lead to conflicts, missing, and ambiguous requirements. In order to overcome this problem, Machine Learning is one of the techniques that can be used to extract the content from the list of requirements and produce the story cards based on the priority and rules of requirements. Thus, this study aims to to propose a new technique of designing story cards based on user requirements. The finding from the study is a conceptual model of designing story cards using Machine Learning technique. Future research will investigate how the technique adapt with the iterative changes of the requirements.

AB Building powerful machine-learning assessment models is an important achievement of empirical software engineering research, but it is not the only one. Intelligibility of such models is also needed, especially, in a domain, software engineering, where exploration and knowledge capture is still a challenge. Several algorithms, belonging to various machine-learning approaches, are selected and run on software data collected from medium size applications. Some of these approaches produce models with very high quantitative performances; others give interpretable, intelligible, and "glass-box" models that are very complementary. We consider that the integration of both, in automated decision-making systems for assessing software product quality, is desirable to reach a compromise between performance and intelligibility.

AB Non-structural proteins 5B (NS5B) play an important role in protein maturation and gene replication as an RNA dependent RNA polymerase in the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Inhibiting NS5B polymerase will prevent RNA replication and, therefore, it is significant for the treatment of HCV. It is becoming increasingly important to screen and predict molecules that have NS5B inhibitory activity by computational methods. This work explores several machine learning (ML) methods (support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and C4.5 decision tree (C4.5 DT)) for the prediction of NS5B inhibitors (NS5BIs). This prediction system was tested using 1248 compounds (552 NS5BIs and 696 non-NS5BIs), which are significantly more diverse in chemical structure than those used in other studies. A feature selection method was used to improve the prediction accuracy and the selection of molecular descriptors responsible for distinguishing between NS5BIs and non-NS5BIs. The prediction accuracies were 81.4%-91.7% for the NS5BIs, 78.2%-87.2% for the non-NS5BIs, and 84.1%-85.0% overall based on the three kinds of machine learning methods. SVM gave the best accuracy of 91.7% for the NS5BIs, C4.5 gave the best accuracy of 87.2% for the non-NS5BIs, and k-NN gave the best overall accuracy of 85.0% for all the compounds. This work suggests that machine learning methods can facilitate the prediction of the NS5BIs potential for unknown sets of compounds and to determine the molecular descriptors associated with NS5BIs.

AB This work examines the effectiveness of machine learning (ML) classifiers on the problems of voice activity detection and voicing classification. A wide range of ML classifiers are considered and include parametric, probabilistic and non-probabilistic, artificial neural networks and regression. Evaluations are carried out in both stationary and non-stationary noise types at signal-to-noise ratios down to 0dB. In comparison to conventional methods the ML methods are found to be significantly more robust with multilayer perceptrons, Gaussian mixture models and Rotation Forest giving consistently best performance.

AB Among childhood cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has been the most extensively studied propelled by the desire to improve survival rate. DNA microarray technology has expanded rapidly providing an extensive source of data that promise to pave the way for better prognosis and diagnosis of cancer and identify key targets for drug development. DNA microarray data analysis has been carried out using statistical analysis as well as machine learning and data mining approaches. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of machine learning approaches that have been used on ALL microarray data. Followed by the research conducted by biological and medical childhood leukaemia research groups, machine learning has been used to enhance cancer diagnosis and subtype classification, development of novel therapeutic approaches and accurate identification of risk stratification of patients. These methods have been used in four major areas of microarray data analysis: gene selection, clustering, classification and pathway analysis. Each machine learning algorithm has its own advantages and drawbacks. Highlights of these as well as some outstanding future research and challenges are summarized in this paper. This review aims to serve as a starting point for those interested in microarray analysis in general and cancer research in particular.

AB We consider projected Newton-type methods for solving large-scale optimization problems arising in machine learning and related fields. We first introduce an algorithmic framework for projected Newton-type methods by reviewing a canonical projected (quasi-)Newton method. This method, while conceptually pleasing, has a high computation cost per iteration. Thus, we discuss two variants that are more scalable: two-metric projection and inexact projection methods. Finally, we show how to apply the Newton-type framework to handle nonsmooth objectives. Examples are provided through-out the chapter to illustrate machine learning applications of our framework.

AB Concrete structural component detection in color images is a key pre-process in various applications such as construction progress measurement, structural health monitoring, and three-dimensional as-built modeling. The goal of this research was to identify an automated color model-based concrete detection method that (by using a machine learning algorithm) can detect concrete structural components in color images with a high level of accuracy. A data set consisting of more than 87 million pixels was generated from 108 images of concrete surfaces with a variety of surfaces. Transformations from the RGB color space to non-RGB color spaces were performed to increase separability between concrete and background classes and to achieve robustness to changes in illumination. To find the optimal combination of color space and machine learning algorithm, the performance of three machine learning algorithms (e.g., a Gaussian mixture model, an artificial neural network model, and a support vector machine model) in two non-RGB color spaces (e.g., HSI and normalized RGB) was comparatively analyzed. The comparison showed that the combination of the support vector machine algorithm and the HSI color space is superior in detecting concrete structural components in color images, compared with the other five algorithm-color space combinations. Performance was validated by experiments run on various images of actual construction-site scenes. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000141. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In this paper ,we deduced an online learning algorithm for direct support vector machine (DSVM). By adding the bias square of hyperplane to the objective function, we introduced the mathematical mode of DSVM for regression which was extremely fast and simple, then we designed incremental and online learning algorithms by using the property of block matrix and kernel function matrix. Experimental results of simulation by using Mackey-Glass chaotic time series indicate the feasibility of the learning algorithm.

The stored data (virtual courses, e-learning log file, demographic and academic data of students, admissions/registration info, and so on) can be useful for machine learning algorithms. In this article, we cite the most current articles that use machine learning techniques for educational proposes and we present a case study for predicting students' marks. Students' key demographic characteristics and their marks in a small number of written assignments can constitute the training set for a regression method in order to predict the student's performance. Finally, a prototype version of software support tool for tutors has been constructed.

This situation made power system operate close to steady-state stability limit (SSSL). It could trigger voltage instability or voltage collapse phenomenon. An assessment approach on steady state stability analysis was provided using Extreme Learning Machine taking the Modal Analysis as an assessment index. The nonlinear problem between voltage, power flow and participation factor in power system could be solved by Extreme Learning Machine. The method was tested on the IEEE 14 bus and Java-Bali system.

ID OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK; GROUNDWATER; RECHARGE; SYSTEMS
AB There is a large class of modeling problems where the complexity of the underlying phenomena is overwhelming and hence the accuracy of mathematical models is limited. Our approach to this class of problems is to design frameworks that bring together physically based and data-driven models, and incorporate the tacit knowledge of experts by providing visual exploration and feedback capabilities. This paper presents such a novel computer-assisted framework for accurate geospatial modeling applied to improve groundwater recharge and discharge (R/D) patterns. The novelty of our work is in designing a methodology for ranking and extracting relationships, as well as in developing a general framework for building accurate geospatial models. The framework combines variables derived using physically based inverse modeling with auxiliary geospatial variables directly sensed, ranks variables and extracts variable relationships using data-driven ("machine learning") techniques, and supports partially expert-driven trial-and-error experimentation and more rigorous optimization, as well as visual explorations, to derive more accurate models for R/D pattern estimation. When the framework was tested by experts, it led to a high level of consistency between the machine-learning-based knowledge and the experts' knowledge about R/D distribution. The prototype solution of the framework is available for downloading at http://isda.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Sp2Learn/.

AB New variations on the application of the passive-aggressive algorithm to statistical machine translation are developed and compared to previously existing approaches. In online adaptation, the system needs to adapt to real-world changing scenarios, where training and tuning only take place when the system is set-up for the first time. Post-edit information, as described by a given quality measure, is used as valuable feedback within the passive-aggressive framework, adapting the statistical models on-line. First, by modifying the translation model parameters, and alternatively, by adapting the scaling factors present in state-of-the-art SMT systems. Experimental results show improvements in translation quality by allowing the system to learn on a sentence-by-sentence basis.

AB Identifying mammalian vigilance states has recently become an important topic in biological science research. The vigilance states are usually categorized in at least three states, including slow wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement sleep (REM), and awakening. To identify different vigilance states, even a well-trained expert must spend a lot of time analyzing a mass of physiological recording data. This study proposes an automatic vigilance stages classification method for analyzing EEG signals in rats. The EEG signals were transferred by fast Fourier transform before extracting features. These extracted features were then used as training patterns to construct the proposed classification system. The proposed classification system contains two functional units. The first unit is principle component analysis (PCA) method, which is used to project the high dimensional features into the lower dimensional subspace. The second unit is the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method, which identifies the physiological state in each EEG signal epoch. Based on the results of analyzing 810 epochs of EEG signal, the proposed classification method achieves satisfactory classification accuracy for vigilance states. Based on machine-learning algorithms, the classifier learns to approach the configuration that best fits the categorization task. Therefore, additional training in searching best parameters and thresholds can be avoided. Moreover, the PCA algorithm projects data instances into a 3-D space, making it possible to visualize state-changing dynamics. Experimental results show that the proposed machine-learning based classifier performs better than conventional vigilance state classification algorithms. The results also suggest that it is possible to identify the vigilance states with only EEG signals using the proposed pattern recognition technique.

AB Objective: The prediction of survival time after organ transplantations and prognosis analysis of different risk groups of transplant patients are not only clinically important but also technically challenging. The current studies, which are mostly linear modeling-based statistical analyses, have focused on small sets of disparate predictive factors where many potentially important variables are neglected in their analyses. Data mining methods, such as machine learning-based approaches, are capable of providing an effective way of overcoming these limitations by utilizing sufficiently large data sets with many predictive factors to identify not only linear associations but also highly complex, non-linear relationships. Therefore, this study is aimed at exploring risk groups of thoracic recipients through machine learning-based methods.
   Methods and material: A large, feature-rich, nation-wide thoracic transplantation dataset (obtained from the United Network for Organ Sharing UNOS) is used to develop predictive models for the survival time estimation. The predictive factors that are most relevant to the survival time identified via, (1) conducting sensitivity analysis on models developed by the machine learning methods, (2) extraction of variables from the published literature, and (3) eliciting variables from the medical experts and other domain specific knowledge bases. A unified set of predictors is then used to develop a Cox regression model and the related prognosis indices. A comparison of clustering algorithm-based and conventional risk grouping techniques is conducted based on the outcome of the Cox regression model in order to identify optimal number of risk groups of thoracic recipients. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is performed to validate the discrimination among the identified various risk groups.
   Results: The machine learning models performed very effectively in predicting the survival time: the support vector machine model with a radial basis Kernel function produced the best fit with an R-2 value of 0.879, the artificial neural network (multilayer perceptron-MLP-model) came the second with an R2 value of 0.847, and the M5 algorithm-based regression tree model came last with an R-2 value of 0.785. Following the proposed method, a consolidated set of predictive variables are determined and used to build the Cox survival model. Using the prognosis indices revealed by the Cox survival model along with a k-means clustering algorithm, an optimal number of "three" risk groups is identified. The significance of differences among these risk groups are also validated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the integrated machine learning method to select the predictor variables is more effective in developing the Cox survival models than the traditional methods commonly found in the literature. The significant distinction among the risk groups of thoracic patients also validates the effectiveness of the methodology proposed herein. We anticipate that this study (and other AI based analytic studies like this one) will lead to more effective analyses of thoracic transplant procedures to better understand the prognosis of thoracic organ recipients. It would potentially lead to new medical and biological advances and more effective allocation policies in the field of organ transplantation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sludge deposits resulting from mine extraction activities and accumulating in the proximity of production centres have an important potential impact on their surroundings.
   This potential impact needs to be evaluated by quantifying the risk of an accident on the basis of a joint study of factors affecting the probability of occurrence, environmental, populational and infrastructural vulnerability factors and intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors.
   The problem is non-linear, and this fact, combined with the high number of risk conditioning variables, justifies using machine learning techniques to estimate risk. A comparison of results for supervised versus non-supervised learning techniques confirms that the former adapts better to the problem than the latter. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The assessment of promotional sales with models constructed by machine learning techniques is arousing interest due, among other reasons, to the current economic situation leading to a more complex environment of simultaneous and concurrent promotional activities. An operative model diagnosis procedure was previously proposed in the companion paper, which can be readily used both for agile decision making on the architecture and implementation details of the machine learning algorithms, and for differential benchmarking among models. In this paper, a detailed example of model analysis is presented for two representative databases with different promotional behaviour, namely, a non-seasonal category (milk) and a heavily seasonal category (beer). The performance of four well-known machine learning techniques with increasing complexity is analyzed in detail here. In particular, k-Nearest Neighbours, General Regression Neural Networks, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are differentially compared. Present paper evaluates these techniques along the experiments described for both categories when applying the methodological findings obtained in the companion paper. We conclude that some elements included in the architecture are not essential for a good performance of the machine learning promotional models, such as the semiparametric nature of the kernel in SVM models, whereas other can be strongly dependent of the database, such as the convenience of multiple output models in MLP regression schemes. Additionally, the specificity of the behaviour of certain categories and product ranges determines the need to establish suitable and specific procedures for a better prediction and feature extraction.

AB We present approaches for gesture classification and gesture segmentation by using machine learning on the Kinect sensor's data stream. Our work involved three phases. Firstly we developed gesture classification from a known vocabulary of gestures in an edited data stream. Secondly we extended those techniques to detect and classify a gesture in an unedited stream which also captures random movements. Thirdly, we apply rules to filter out movements that were not intentional gestures and yet resembled certain gestures in our vocabulary.

AB In this paper, we consider the asymptotic form of the generalization error for the restricted Boltzmann machine in Bayesian estimation. It has been shown that obtaining the maximum pole of zeta functions is related to the asymptotic form of the generalization error for hierarchical learning models (Watanabe, 2001a,b). The zeta function is defined by using a Kullback function. We use two methods to obtain the maximum pole: a new eigenvalue analysis method and a recursive blowing up process. We show that these methods are effective for obtaining the asymptotic form of the generalization error of hierarchical learning models.

AB Analysis of gene expression data has emerged as an important approach to discover active pathways related to biological phenotypes. Previous pathway analysis methods use all genes in a pathway for linking it to a particular phenotype. Using only a subset of informative genes, however, could better classify samples. Here, we propose a two-stage machine learning approach for pathway analysis. During the first stage, informative genes that can represent a pathway are selected using feature selection methods. These "representative genes" are mostly associated with the phenotype of interest. In the second stage, pathways are ranked based on their "representative genes" using classification methods. We applied our two-stage approach on three gene expression datasets. The results indicate our method does outperform methods that consider every gene in a pathway.

AB This paper proposes the development of water sample classification and authentication, in real life which is based on machine learning algorithms. The proposed techniques used experimental measurements from a pulse voltametry method which is based on an electronic tongue (E-tongue) instrumentation system with silver and platinum electrodes. E-tongue include arrays of solid state ion sensors, transducers even of different types, data collectors and data analysis tools, all oriented to the classification of liquid samples and authentication of unknown liquid samples. The time series signal and the corresponding raw data represent the measurement from a multi-sensor system. The E-tongue system, implemented in a laboratory environment for 6 numbers of different ISI (Bureau of Indian standard) certified water samples (Aquafina, Bisleri, Kingfisher, Oasis, Dolphin, and McDowell) was the data source for developing two types of machine learning algorithms like classification and regression. A water data set consisting of 6 numbers of sample classes containing 4402 numbers of features were considered. A PCA (principal component analysis) based classification and authentication tool was developed in this study as the machine learning component of the E-tongue system. A proposed partial least squares (PLS) based classifier, which was dedicated as well; to authenticate a specific category of water sample evolved out as an integral part of the E-tongue instrumentation system. The developed PCA and PLS based E-tongue system emancipated an overall encouraging authentication percentage accuracy with their excellent performances for the aforesaid categories of water samples.

AB Our ultimate objective in data mining is to identify any hidden patterns or relationships between our data elements, and in one sense, machine learning provides us with a set of techniques to do just that: techniques that allow us to learn the patterns without any outside influence (unsupervised learning). However, just as is the case with anything, that power comes at a price, but the results can be very interesting and very significant. In other cases, we have some sense on what the results should be and so can guide the learning techniques through an initial "training" phase, directing our system and honing the results (supervised learning). These two broad classifications of machine-learning methods will ground us as we discuss a broad range of techniques and where they are currently being applied in life sciences research, expanding our toolkit and enabling us to take a very different path in our analysis efforts: using an artificial intelligence discipline and letting the data tell us what it contains. As datasets grow, these techniques become more important.

AB Traditional extreme learning machine (ELM) may require high number of hidden neurons and lead to ill-condition problem due to the random determination of the input weights and hidden biases. In this paper, we use a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to select the input weights and hidden biases of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) and Moore-Penrose (MP) generalized inverse to analytically determine the output weights. The modified PSO optimizes the input weights and hidden biases according to not only the root mean squared error on validation set but also the norm of the output weights. The proposed algorithm has better generalization performance than other ELMs and its conditioning is also improved.

AB In this paper, we propose a new learning effect model in which the actual job processing time is a general function of the normal processing time of jobs already processed and its scheduled position. This model has the advantage that different learning curves can be constructed easily, such as the plateau function. It is found that most of the models in the literature are special cases of our proposed model. The optimal sequences for some single-machine problems are then provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Machine learning methods have been successfully applied to image object classification problems where there is clear distinction between classes and where a comprehensive set of training samples and ground truth are readily available. The transportation domain is an area where machine learning methods are particularly applicable, since the classification problems typically have well defined class boundaries and, due to high traffic volumes in most applications, massive roadway data is available. Though these classes tend to be well defined, the particular image noises and variations can be challenging. Another challenge is the extremely high accuracy typically required in most traffic applications. Incorrect assignment of fines or tolls due to imaging mistakes is not acceptable in most applications. For the front seat vehicle occupancy detection problem, classification amounts to determining whether one face (driver only) or two faces (driver + passenger) are detected in the front seat of a vehicle on a roadway. For automatic license plate recognition, the classification problem is a type of optical character recognition problem encompassing multiple class classification. The SNoW machine learning classifier using local SMQT features is shown to be successful in these two transportation imaging applications.

AB Suggesting tasks and learning resources of appropriate difficulty to learners is challenging. Neither should they be too difficult and nor too easy. Well-chosen tasks would enable a quick assessment of the learner, well-chosen learning resources would speed up the learning curve most. We connect active learning to classical pedagogical theory and propose the uncertainty sampling framework as a means to the challenge of selecting optimal tasks and learning resources to learners. To assess the efficiency of this strategy, we compared different exercise selection strategies and evaluated their effect on different datasets. We consistently find that uncertainty sampling significantly outperforms several alternative exercise selection approaches and thus leads to a faster convergence to the true assessment. These findings demonstrate that active (machine) learning is consistent with classic learning theory. It is a valuable instrument for choosing appropriate exercises as well as learning resources both from a teacher's and from a learner's perspective.

AB Scheduling with multiple agents and learning effect has drawn much attention. In this paper, we investigate the job scheduling problem of two agents competing for the usage of a common single machine with learning effect. The objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time of both agents with the restriction that the makespan of either agent cannot exceed an upper bound. In order to solve this problem we develop several dominance properties and a lower bound based on a branch-and-bound to find the optimal algorithm, and derive genetic algorithm based procedures for finding near-optimal solutions. The performances of the proposed algorithms are evaluated and compared via computational experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we calibrate the Vasicek interest rate model under the risk neutral measure by learning the model parameters using Gaussian processes for machine learning regression. The calibration is done by maximizing the likelihood of zero coupon bond log prices, using mean and covariance functions computed analytically, as well as likelihood derivatives with respect to the parameters. The maximization method used is the conjugate gradients. The only prices needed for calibration are zero coupon bond prices and the parameters are directly obtained in the arbitrage free risk neutral measure.

AB In this paper we consider the single machine scheduling problems with exponential sum-of-logarithm-processing-times based learning effect. By the exponential sum-of-logarithm-processing-times based learning effect, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by an exponent function of the sum of the logarithm of the processing times of the jobs already processed. We consider the following objective functions: the make-span, the total completion time, the sum of the quadratic job completion times, the total weighted completion time and the maximum lateness. We show that the make-span minimization problem, the total completion time minimization problem and the sum of the quadratic job completion times minimization problem can be solved by the smallest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule, respectively. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions.

AB In order to develop a computational method to rapidly evaluate transdermal peptides, we report approaches for predicting the transdermal activity of peptides on the basis of peptide sequence information using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We identified 269 transdermal peptides by the phage display technique and use them as the positive controls to develop and test machine learning models. Combinations of three descriptors with neural network architectures, the number of latent variables and the kernel functions are tried in training to make appropriate predictions. The capacity of models is evaluated by means of statistical indicators including sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC score). In the ROC score-based comparison, three methods proved capable of providing a reasonable prediction of transdermal peptide. The best result is obtained by SVM model with a radial basis function and VHSE descriptors. The results indicate that it is possible to discriminate between transdermal peptides and random sequences using our models. We anticipate that our models will be applicable to prediction of transdermal peptide for large peptide database for facilitating efficient transdermal drug delivery through intact skin.

AB Accurate and robust image analysis software is crucial for assessing the quality of ultrasound images of fetal biometry. In this work, we present the result of our automated image analysis method based on a machine learning algorithm in detecting important anatomical landmarks employed in manual scoring of ultrasound images of the fetal abdomen. Experimental results on 2384 images are promising and the clinical validation using 300 images demonstrates a high level agreement between the automated method and experts.

A diagnostics education belongs to field of study where e-learning is used less commonly than in other fields for its necessity to attending a laboratory. Laboratory education, forms an integral part of many university courses, mainly in natural and technical university education, are necessary to improve students' knowledge by experiments with laboratory samples and devices. There could arise a problem for foreign and distance students, who cannot physically attend these courses. Therefore the aim of this project is presentation of a possible solution on the example of laboratory electro-mechanical device fully accessible via Internet.

AB Action learning is a methodology based on a machine learning system that makes it possible to select a suitable action or sequence of actions given a state. The main drawback of this methodology is the difficulty of assigning a class to the state-action pair to be included in the training set. This paper proposes an active learning methodology in the learning phase of an action learning process. With the help of an artificial example, the active methodology is compared with a passive methodology consisting of randomly selecting the training set from the pool of unlabelled patterns.

DE Tags; Web services; Text mining; Machine learning
AB The importancy of Web services comes from the fact that they are an important means to realize SOA applications. Their increasing popularity caused the emergence of a fairly huge number of services. Therefore, finding a particular service among this large service space can be a hard task. User tags have proven to be a useful technique to smooth browsing experience in large document collections. Some service search engines proposes the facility of service tagging. It is usually done manually by the providers and the users of the services, which can be a fairly tedious and error prone task. In this paper we propose an approach for tagging Web services automatically. It adapts techniques from text mining and machine learning to extract tags from WSDL descriptions. Then it enriches these tags by extracting relevant synonyms using WordNet. We validated our approach on a corpus of 146 services extracted from Seekda.

AB The few studies that deal with machine translation (MT) as a language learning tool focus on its use by advanced learners, never by beginners. Yet, freely available MT engines (i.e. Google Translate) and MT-related web initiatives (i.e. Gabble-on. com) position themselves to cater precisely to the needs of learners with a limited command of a second language (L2). Anecdotal classroom evidence points to beginners availing themselves of MT help, even against the advice of teachers. In order to find out whether MT could help develop learners' writing skills in L2, we ran some tests asking participants to write directly into L2 in one instance and into L1 in another, while pre-editing the L1 and post-editing the L2 within the MT's Tradukka. com interface. Analysis of the output produced has found that MT helps beginners to communicate more, particularly when they had a lesser mastery of the language. The less their mastery of the L2, the greater the difference between the number of words composed with the help of MT and the number of those written directly into L2. It also helped them to communicate better, with blind marking indicating higher quality when writing with MT mediation. Looking at the screen recordings, on the other hand, we found that writing directly into L2 requires more effort, as measured by number of pauses, and involves more engagement with the task, as measured by the number of editing interventions.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB It is not very often to see a symbol-based machine learning approach to be used for the purpose of image classification and recognition. In this paper we will present such an approach, which we first used on the follicular lymphoma images. Lymphoma is a broad term encompassing a variety of cancers of the lymphatic system. Lymphoma is differentiated by the type of cell that multiplies and how the cancer presents itself. It is very important to get an exact diagnosis regarding lymphoma and to determine the treatments that will be most effective for the patient's condition. Our work was focused on the identification of lymphomas by finding follicles in microscopy images provided by the Laboratory of Pathology in the University Hospital of Tenerife, Spain. We divided our work in two stages: in the first stage we did image pre-processing and feature extraction, and in the second stage we used different symbolic machine learning approaches for pixel classification. Symbolic machine learning approaches are often neglected when looking for image analysis tools. They are not only known for a very appropriate knowledge representation, but also claimed to lack computational power. The results we got are very promising and show that symbolic approaches can be successful in image analysis applications.

LA English

   control; Intelligent transportation systems; Artificial intelligence;
   Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Q-learning
AB Urban traffic corridors are often controlled by more than one agency. Typically in North America, a state of provincial transportation department controls freeways while another agency at the municipal or city level controls the nearby arterials. While the different segments of the corridor fall under different jurisdictions, traffic and users know no boundaries and expect seamless service. Common lack of coordination amongst those authorities due to lack of means for information exchange and/or possible bureaucratic 'institutional grid-lock' could hinder the full potential of technically-possible integrated control. Such institutional gridlock and related lack of timely coordination amongst the different agencies involved can have a direct impact on traffic gridlock. One potential solution to this problem is through integrated automatic control under intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Advancements in ITS and communication technology have the potential to considerably reduce delay and congestion through an array of network-wide traffic control and management strategies that can seamlessly cross-jurisdictional boundaries. Perhaps two of the most promising such control tools for freeway corridors are traffic-responsive ramp metering and/or dynamic traffic diversion possibly using variable message signs (VMS). Technically, the use of these control methods separately might limit their potential usefulness. Therefore, integrated corridor control using ramp metering and VMS diversion simultaneously might be synergetic and beneficial. Motivated by the above problem and potential solution approach, the aim of the research presented in this paper is to develop a self-learning adaptive integrated freeway-arterial corridor control for both recurring and non-recurring congestion. The paper introduces the use of reinforcement learning, an Artificial Intelligence method for machine learning, to provide optimal control using ramp metering and VMS routing in an integrated agent for a freeway-arterial corridor. Reinforcement learning is an approach whereby the control agent directly learns optimal strategies via feedback reward signals from its environment. A simple but powerful reinforcement learning method known as Q-learning is used. Results from an elaborate simulation study on a key corridor in Toronto are very encouraging and discussed in the paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Researchers have approached knowledge-base construction (KBC) with a wide range of data resources and techniques. The authors present Elementary, a prototype KBC system that is able to combine diverse resources and different KBC techniques via machine learning and statistical inference to construct knowledge bases. Using Elementary, they have implemented a solution to the TAC-KBP challenge with quality comparable to the state of the art, as well as an end-to-end online demonstration that automatically and continuously enriches Wikipedia with structured data by reading millions of webpages on a daily basis. The authors describe several challenges and their solutions in designing, implementing, and deploying Elementary. In particular, the authors first describe the conceptual framework and architecture of Elementary to integrate different data resources and KBC techniques in a principled manner. They then discuss how they address scalability challenges to enable Web-scale deployment. The authors empirically show that this decomposition-based inference approach achieves higher performance than prior inference approaches. To validate the effectiveness of Elementary's approach to KBC, they experimentally show that its ability to incorporate diverse signals has positive impacts on KBC quality.

AB Automatic adult video detection is a problem of interest to many organizations around the world. The aim is to restrict the easy access of underage youngsters to such potentially harmful material. Most of the existing techniques are mere extensions of image categorization approaches. In this paper we propose a video genre classification technique tuned specifically for adult content detection by considering cinematographic principles. Spatial and temporal simple features are used with machine learning algorithms to perform the classification into two classes: adult and non-offensive video material. Shot duration and camera motion, are the temporal domain features, and skin detection and color histogram are the spatial domain ones. Using two data sets of 7 and 15 hours of video material, our experiments comparing two different SVM classifiers achieved an accuracy of 94.44%.

AB This paper describes the BiomedTK software framework, created to perform massive explorations of machine learning classifiers configurations for biomedical data analysis over distributed Grid computing resources. BiomedTK integrates ROC analysis throughout the complete classifier construction process and enables explorations of large parameter sweeps for training third party classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines, offering the capability to harness the vast amount of computing power serviced by Grid infrastructures. In addition, it includes classifiers modified by the authors for ROC optimization and functionality to build ensemble classifiers and manipulate datasets (import/export, extract and transform data, etc.). BiomedTK was experimentally validated by training thousands of classifier configurations for representative biomedical UCI datasets reaching in little time classification levels comparable to those reported in existing literature. The comprehensive method herewith presented represents an improvement to biomedical data analysis in both methodology and potential reach of machine learning based experimentation.

TI CANTINA+: A Feature-Rich Machine Learning Framework for Detecting
   Phishing Web Sites
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEM SECURITY
LA English
DT Article
DE Algorithms; Security; Languages; Anti-phishing; machine learning;
   information retrieval
AB Phishing is a plague in cyberspace. Typically, phish detection methods either use human-verified URL blacklists or exploit Web page features via machine learning techniques. However, the former is frail in terms of new phish, and the latter suffers from the scarcity of effective features and the high false positive rate (FP). To alleviate those problems, we propose a layered anti-phishing solution that aims at (1) exploiting the expressiveness of a rich set of features with machine learning to achieve a high true positive rate (TP) on novel phish, and (2) limiting the FP to a low level via filtering algorithms.
   Specifically, we proposed CANTINA+, the most comprehensive feature-based approach in the literature including eight novel features, which exploits the HTML Document Object Model (DOM), search engines and third party services with machine learning techniques to detect phish. Moreover, we designed two filters to help reduce FP and achieve runtime speedup. The first is a near-duplicate phish detector that uses hashing to catch highly similar phish. The second is a login form filter, which directly classifies Web pages with no identified login form as legitimate.
   We extensively evaluated CANTINA+ with two methods on a diverse spectrum of corpora with 8118 phish and 4883 legitimate Web pages. In the randomized evaluation, CANTINA+ achieved over 92% TP on unique testing phish and over 99% TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 0.4% FP with 10% training phish. In the time-based evaluation, CANTINA+ also achieved over 92% TP on unique testing phish, over 99% TP on near-duplicate testing phish, and about 1.4% FP under 20% training phish with a two-week sliding window. Capable of achieving 0.4% FP and over 92% TP, our CANTINA+ has been demonstrated to be a competitive anti-phishing solution.

ID SYSTEM
AB In this article an approach is presented where machine learning classifiers are used to drive an ensemble modeling method of multiple atmospheric transport and dispersion simulations. The goal is to achieve a higher spread of the results with a lower number of ensemble simulations. Symbolic machine learning algorithms are used to define choices for the variation of meteorological input data, model parameters, model physics, based on their combined effects on the final dispersion calculations (i.e., construction of ensembles).
   The methodology uses an iterative approach with the aim to identify ensemble members leading to a more balanced distribution of results. The methodology is tested using real meteorological data from Istanbul. Turkey, simulating atmospheric releases along the Bosphorus channel. In an extensive evaluation, different settings of the approach are compared in a series of experiments. The results indicate that the desired effect of more balanced results of the ensemble members can be achieved by the approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Active learning is showing to be a useful approach to improve the efficiency of the classification process for remote sensing images. This letter introduces a new active learning strategy specifically developed for support vector machine (SVM) classification. It relies on the idea of the following: 1) reformulating the original classification problem into a new problem where it is needed to discriminate between significant and nonsignificant samples, according to a concept of significance which is proper to the SVM theory; and 2) constructing the corresponding significance space to suitably guide the selection of the samples potentially useful to better deal with the original classification problem. Experiments were conducted on both multi-and hyperspectral images. Results show interesting advantages of the proposed method in terms of convergence speed, stability, and sparseness.

AB This paper presents a supervised learning approach to improving the autonomous mobility of wheeled robots through sensing the robot's interaction with terrain 'underfoot.' Mobility characterization is cast as a hierarchical task, in which pre-immobilization detection is achieved using support vector machines in time to prevent full immobilization, and if a pre-immobilization condition is detected, the associated terrain feature affecting mobility is identified using a Hidden Markov model. These methods are implemented using a hierarchical, layered control scheme developed for the Yeti robot, a 73-kg, four-wheeled robot designed to perform autonomous medium-range missions in polar terrain. The methodology is motivated by the difficultly of visually recognizing terrain features that impact mobility in low contrast terrain. The efficacy of the approach is evaluated using data from a suite of proprioceptive sensors. Real-time implementation shows that Yeti can consistently detect pre-immobilization conditions, stop in time to avoid unrecoverable immobilization, identify the terrain feature presenting the mobility challenge, and execute an escape sequence to retreat from the condition.

DE Traffic Classification; Machine Learning; Performance
AB A multi-service Internet requires routers to recognise and prioritise IP flows carrying interactive or multimedia traffic. It is increasingly problematic for legal or administrative reasons to recognise such flows using unique port numbers or deep packet inspection. New work in recent years shows that Machine Learning (ML) techniques can use externally observable statistical characteristics to usefully differentiate such IP traffic. However, most previous work has not addressed the practicality of ML-based traffic classification in terms of CPU and memory usage. Here we describe our design, implementation and performance evaluation of a distributed, ML-based traffic classification and control system for FreeBSD's IP Firewall (IPFW). On an Intel Core i7 2.8 GHz PC our system can classify up to 400 000 packets per second using only one core and our system scales well to up to 100 000 simultaneous flows. Also our implementation allows one classifier PC to control subsequent traffic shaping or blocking at multiple (potentially lower performance) routers or gateways distributed around the network.

Its experimental results are compared with BP(back propagation) neural network, and we found that ELM is better than BP to describe the non-linear relationship between the characteristics parameters and the initial permeability, and can be used for sorting and semi-quantitative measurement of the characteristics parameters of ferromagnetic materials.

AB Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have achieved very good performance on different learning problems. However, the success of SVMs depends on the adequate choice of the values of a number of parameters (e.g., the kernel and regularization parameters). In the current work, we propose the combination of meta-learning and search algorithms to deal with the problem of SVM parameter selection. In this combination, given a new problem to be solved, meta-learning is employed to recommend SVM parameter values based on parameter configurations that have been successfully adopted in previous similar problems. The parameter values returned by meta-learning are then used as initial search points by a search technique, which will further explore the parameter space. In this proposal, we envisioned that the initial solutions provided by meta-learning are located in good regions of the search space (i.e. they are closer to optimum solutions). Hence, the search algorithm would need to evaluate a lower number of candidate solutions when looking for an adequate solution. In this work, we investigate the combination of meta-learning with two search algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization and Tabu Search. The implemented hybrid algorithms were used to select the values of two SVM parameters in the regression domain. These combinations were compared with the use of the search algorithms without meta-learning. The experimental results on a set of 40 regression problems showed that, on average, the proposed hybrid methods obtained lower error rates when compared to their components applied in isolation.

AB Machine learning techniques such as classification and regression trees (CART) have been suggested as promising alternatives to logistic regression for the estimation of propensity scores. The authors examined the performance of various CART-based propensity score models using simulated data. Hypothetical studies of varying sample sizes (n=500, 1000, 2000) with a binary exposure, continuous outcome, and 10 covariates were simulated under seven scenarios differing by degree of non-linear and non-additive associations between covariates and the exposure. Propensity score weights were estimated using logistic regression (all main effects), CART, pruned CART, and the ensemble methods of bagged CART, random forests, and boosted CART. Performance metrics included covariate balance, standard error, per cent absolute bias, and 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) coverage. All methods displayed generally acceptable performance under conditions of either non-linearity or non-additivity alone. However, under conditions of both moderate non-additivity and moderate non-linearity, logistic regression had subpar performance, whereas ensemble methods provided substantially better bias reduction and more consistent 95 per cent CI coverage. The results suggest that ensemble methods, especially boosted CART, may be useful for propensity score weighting. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We present MaSiF, a novel tool to auto-tune parallelization parameters of skeleton parallel programs. It reduces the cost of searching the optimization space using a combination of machine learning and linear dimensionality reduction. To auto-tune a new program, a set of program features is determined statically and used to compute k nearest neighbors from a set of training programs. Previously collected performance data for the nearest neighbors is used to reduce the size of the search space using Principal Components Analysis. This results in a set of eigenvectors that are used to search the reduced space.
   MaSiF achieves 88% of the performance of the oracle, which searches a random set of 10,000 parameter values. MaSiF searches just 45 points, or 0.45% of the optimization space, to achieve this performance. MaSiF provides an average speedup of 1.18x over parallelization parameters chosen by a human expert.

AB Sorting and clustering large numbers of documents can be an overwhelming task: manual solutions tend to be slow, while machine learning systems often present results that don't align well with users' intents. We created and evaluated a system for helping users sort large numbers of documents into clusters. iCluster has the capability to recommend new items for existing clusters and appropriate clusters for items. The recommendations are based on a learning model that adapts over time - as the user adds more items to a cluster, the system's model improves and the recommendations become more relevant. Thirty-two subjects used iCluster to sort hundreds of data items both with and without recommendations; we found that recommendations allow users to sort items more rapidly. A pool of 161 raters then assessed the quality of the resulting clusters, finding that clusters generated with recommendations were of statistically indistinguishable quality. Both the manual and assisted methods were substantially better than a fully automatic method.

AB In this paper, a new algorithm based on case base reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to increase the convergence rate of the reinforcement learning algorithms RL algorithms are very useful for solving wide variety decision problems when their models are not available and they must make decision correctly in every state of system, such as multi agent systems, artificial control systems, robotic, tool condition monitoring and etc. In the propose method, we investigate how making improved action selection in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. In the proposed method, the new combined model using case base reasoning systems and a new optimized function is proposed to select the action, which led to an increase in algorithms based on Q-learning. The algorithm mentioned was used for solving the problem of cooperative Markov's games as one of the models of Markov based multi-agent systems. The results of experiments Indicated that the proposed algorithms perform better than the existing algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy of reaching the optimal policy.

AB Ball bearings faults are one of the main causes of breakdown of rotating machines. Thus, detection and diagnosis of mechanical faults in ball bearings is very crucial for the reliable operation. This study is focused on fault diagnosis of ball bearings using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). A test rig of high speed rotor supported on rolling bearings is used. The vibration response are obtained and analyzed for the various defects of ball bearings. The specific defects are considered as crack in outer race, inner race with rough surface and corrosion pitting in balls. Statistical methods are used to extract features and to reduce the dimensionality of original vibration features. A comparative experimental study of the effectiveness of ANN and SVM is carried out. The results show that the machine learning algorithms mentioned above can be used for automated diagnosis of bearing faults. It is also observed that the severe (chaotic) vibrations occur under bearings with rough inner race surface and ball with corrosion pitting. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Parallelism
AB Stream based languages are a popular approach to expressing parallelism in modern applications. The efficient mapping of streaming parallelism to multi-core processors is, however, highly dependent on the program and underlying architecture. We address this by developing a portable and automatic compiler-based approach to partitioning streaming programs using machine learning. Our technique predicts the ideal partition structure for a given streaming application using prior knowledge learned off-line. Using the predictor we rapidly search the program space (without executing any code) to generate and select a good partition. We applied this technique to standard Stream It applications and compared against existing approaches. On a 4-core platform, our approach achieves 60% of the best performance found by iteratively compiling and executing over 3000 different partitions per program. We obtain, on average, a 1.90x speedup over the already tuned partitioning scheme of the Stream It compiler. When compared against a state-of-the-art analytical, model-based approach, we achieve, on average, a 1.77x performance improvement. By porting our approach to a 8-core platform, we are able to obtain 1.8x improvement over the Stream It default scheme, demonstrating the portability of our approach.

AB In this study, we developed new computational DNA adduct prediction models by using significantly more diverse training data-set of 217 DNA adducts and 1024 non-DNA adducts, and applying five machine learning methods which include support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour, artificial neural networks, logistic regression and continuous kernel discrimination. The molecular descriptors used for DNA adduct prediction were selected from a pool of 548 descriptors by using a multi-step hybrid feature selection method combining Fischer-score and Monte Carlo simulated annealing method. Some of the selected descriptors are consistent with the structural and physicochemical properties reported to be important for DNA adduct formation. The y-scrambling method was used to test whether there is a chance correlation in the developed SVM model. In the meantime, fivefold cross-validation of these machine learning methods results in the prediction accuracies of 64.1-82.5% for DNA adducts and 95.1-97.6% for non-DNA adducts, and the prediction accuracies for external test set are 78.2-100% for DNA adducts and 92.6-98.4% for non-DNA adducts. Our study suggested that the tested machine learning methods are potentially useful for DNA adducts identification.

AB Cancer is one of the most complex diseases and one of the most effective treatments, radiation therapy, is also a complicated process. Informatics is becoming a critical tool for clinicians and scientists for improvements to the treatment and a better understanding of the disease. Computational techniques such as Machine Learning have been increasingly used in radiation therapy. As complex as cancer is, this book chapter shows that a machine learning technique has the ability to provide physicians information for better diagnostic, to obtain tumor location for more accurate treatment delivery, and to predict radiotherapy response so that personalized treatment can be developed.

AB We focus on two aspects of the face recognition, feature extraction and classification. We propose a two component system, introducing Lattice Independent Component Analysis (LICA) for feature extraction and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) for classification. In previous works we have proposed LICA for a variety of image processing tasks. The first step of LICA is to identify strong lattice independent components from the data. In the second step, the set of strong lattice independent vector are used for linear unmixing of the data, obtaining a vector of abundance coefficients. The resulting abundance values are used as features for classification, specifically for face recognition. Extreme Learning Machines are accurate and fast-learning innovative classification methods based on the random generation of the input-to-hidden-units weights followed by the resolution of the linear equations to obtain the hidden-to-output weights. The LICA-ELM system has been tested against state-of-the-art feature extraction methods and classifiers, outperforming them when performing cross-validation on four large unbalanced face databases.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of extracting opinions from natural language texts, which is one of the tasks of sentiment analysis. We provide an overview of existing approaches to sentiment analysis including supervised (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy, and SVM) and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply three supervised learning methods-Naive Bayes, KNN, and a method based on the Jaccard index - to the dataset of Internet user reviews about cars and report the results. When learning a user opinion on a specific feature of a car such as speed or comfort, it turns out that training on full unprocessed reviews decreases the classification accuracy. We experiment with different approaches to preprocessing reviews in order to obtain representations that are relevant for the feature one wants to learn and show the effect of each representation on the accuracy of classification.

AB The classification problem can be addressed by numerous techniques and algorithms which belong to different paradigms of machine learning. In this paper, we are interested in evolutionary algorithms, the so-called genetics-based machine learning algorithms. In particular, we will focus on evolutionary approaches that evolve a set of rules, i.e., evolutionary rule-based systems, applied to classification tasks, in order to provide a state of the art in this field. This paper has a double aim: to present a taxonomy of the genetics-based machine learning approaches for rule induction, and to develop an empirical analysis both for standard classification and for classification with imbalanced data sets. We also include a comparative study of the genetics-based machine learning (GBML) methods with some classical non-evolutionary algorithms, in order to observe the suitability and high potential of the search performed by evolutionary algorithms and the behavior of the GBML algorithms in contrast to the classical approaches, in terms of classification accuracy.

AB The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a simplified neural network. It non-linearly embeds input data in a higher dimensional space using randomly generated sigmoidal basis functions. The training target vector is then approximated by a linear weighted sum of these basis functions. In this paper the ELM algorithm has been applied to classify static hand gestures that represent different letters of the Auslan(Australian Sign Language) dictionary. ELM offers very fast learning with very consistent performance. It has only one tuning parameter. It can be adapted to multiclass classification and multi output regression without any increase in training time. Its low computational intensity and short training time makes it superior to traditional algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Single and Recurrent Feed Forward Neural Networks for real time translations.
   Preliminary experimental results have shown that ELM can produce good generalization performance as a classifier. Increasing the dimensionality of the data results in better separation. Consequently the gestures become more distinguishable improving the probability of correct classification. An investigation into its classification performance for the entire alphabet is currently under way.

AB We present a flexible Machine Learning approach for learning user-specific touch input models to increase touch accuracy on mobile devices. The model is based on flexible, non-parametric Gaussian Process regression and is learned using recorded touch inputs. We demonstrate that significant touch accuracy improvements can be obtained when either raw sensor data is used as an input or when the device's reported touch location is used as an input, with the latter marginally outperforming the former. We show that learned offset functions are highly nonlinear and user-specific and that user-specific models outperform models trained on data pooled from several users. Crucially, significant performance improvements can be obtained with a small (approximate to 200) number of training examples, easily obtained for a particular user through a calibration game or from keyboard entry data.

DE machine learning; natural language processing; biomedical information
AB Detecting negative and speculative information is essential in most biomedical text-mining tasks where these language forms are used to express impressions, hypotheses, or explanations of experimental results. Our research is focused on developing a system based on machine-learning techniques that identifies negation and speculation signals and their scope in clinical texts. The proposed system works in two consecutive phases: first, a classifier decides whether each token in a sentence is a negation/speculation signal or not. Then another classifier determines, at sentence level, the tokens which are affected by the signals previously identified. The system was trained and evaluated on the clinical texts of the BioScope corpus, a freely available resource consisting of medical and biological texts: full-length articles, scientific abstracts, and clinical reports. The results obtained by our system were compared with those of two different systems, one based on regular expressions and the other based on machine learning. Our system's results outperformed the results obtained by these two systems. In the signal detection task, the F-score value was 97.3% in negation and 94.9% in speculation. In the scope-finding task, a token was correctly classified if it had been properly identified as being inside or outside the scope of all the negation signals present in the sentence. Our proposal showed an F score of 93.2% in negation and 80.9% in speculation. Additionally, the percentage of correct scopes (those with all their tokens correctly classified) was evaluated obtaining F scores of 90.9% in negation and 71.9% in speculation.

ID INFORMATION
AB The Machine Learning (ML) field has gained its momentum in almost any domain of research and just recently has become a reliable tool in the medical domain. The empirical domain of automatic learning is used in tasks such as medical decision support, medical imaging, protein-protein interaction, extraction of medical knowledge, and for overall patient management care. ML is envisioned as a tool by which computer-based systems can be integrated in the healthcare field in order to get a better, more efficient medical care. This paper describes a ML-based methodology for building an application that is capable of identifying and disseminating healthcare information. It extracts sentences from published medical papers that mention diseases and treatments, and identifies semantic relations that exist between diseases and treatments. Our evaluation results for these tasks show that the proposed methodology obtains reliable outcomes that could be integrated in an application to be used in the medical care domain. The potential value of this paper stands in the ML settings that we propose and in the fact that we outperform previous results on the same data set.

AB Decision making in financial market is a complex process. A wrong decision can cost millions or even billions of dollars and cause financial catastrophe to the financial institution who manages public funds. We have seen the potential and the promise of AI applications in the financial market for quite a while. However, it is still unclear about the state of the art of AI applications in the financial market today, particularly, with the advancement in machine learning, intelligent agent, and Web 2.0 technologies. This article provides a commentary on the recent advances in machine learning, intelligent agent and other AI techniques in financial market applications, on their successes or failures, and on the future challenges of the machine learning and intelligent agents in the financial market. We observe that utilizing richer data for forecasting market, and developing an integrated framework using Agent-Based Model and Artificial Market for both understanding and forecasting the financial markets would be very promising research areas to pursue.

AB Scalability is one of the main challenges for kernel-based methods and support vector machines (SVMs). The quadratic demand in memory for storing kernel matrices makes it impossible for training on million-size data. Sophisticated decomposition algorithms have been proposed to efficiently train SVMs using only important examples, which ideally are the final support vectors (SVs). However, the ability of the decomposition method is limited to large-scale applications where the number of SVs is still too large for a computer's capacity. From another perspective, the large number of SVs slows down SVMs in the testing phase, making it impractical for many applications. In this paper, we introduce the integration of a vector combination scheme to simplify the SVM solution into an incremental working set selection for SVM training. The main objective of the integration is to maintain a minimal number of final SVs, bringing a minimum resource demand and faster training time. Consequently, the learning machines are more compact and run faster thanks to the small number of vectors included in their solution. Experimental results on large benchmark datasets shows that the proposed condensed SVMs achieve both training and testing efficiency while maintaining a generalization ability equivalent to that of normal SVMs.

AB There is no incremental learning ability for the traditional support vector machine (SVM) and there are all kind of merits and flaws for usually used incremental learning method. Normal SVM is unable to train in large-scale samples, while the computer's memory is limited. In order to resolve this problem and improve training speed of the SVM, we analyze essential characteristic of SVM and bring up the incremental learning algorithm of SVM based on regression of SVM related to SV (support vectors). The algorithm increases the speed of training and can be able to learning with large-scale samples while its regressive precision loses fewer. The experiments show that SVM performs effectively and practically. Its application to prediction of the transition temperature (T(g)) for high molecular polymers show that this model (R(2)=0.9427) proved to be considerably more accurate compared to a ANNs regression model (R(2)=0.9269).

We have shown that multiple-fold gains in speed of processing by S-ELM compared to using SVM for classification, while accuracy efficiencies are comparable to literature. The study indicates that using S-ELM would give a distinct advantage in terms of processing speed and performance for RSA prediction.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) proposed by Huang et al. was developed for generalized single hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) with a wide variety of hidden nodes. It proved to be very fast and effective especially for solving function approximation problems with a predetermined network structure. However, the method for determining the network structure of preliminary ELM may be tedious and may not lead to a parsimonious solution. In this paper, a systematic two-stage algorithm (named TS-ELM) is introduced to handle the problem. In the first stage, a forward recursive algorithm is applied to select the hidden nodes from the candidates randomly generated in each step and add them to the network until the stopping criterion achieves its minimum. The significance of each hidden node is then reviewed in the second stage and the insignificance ones are removed from the network, which drastically reduces the network complexity. The effectiveness of TS-ELM is verified by the empirical studies in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A computationally efficient approach to local learning with kernel methods is presented. The Fast Local Kernel Support Vector Machine (FaLK-SVM) trains a set of local SVMs on redundant neighbourhoods in the training set and an appropriate model for each query point is selected at testing time according to a proximity strategy. Supported by a recent result by Zakai and Ritov (2009) relating consistency and localizability, our approach achieves high classification accuracies by dividing the separation function in local optimisation problems that can be handled very efficiently from the computational viewpoint. The introduction of a fast local model selection further speeds-up the learning process. Learning and complexity bounds are derived for FaLK-SVM, and the empirical evaluation of the approach (with data sets up to 3 million points) showed that it is much faster and more accurate and scalable than state-of-the-art accurate and approximated SVM solvers at least for non high-dimensional data sets. More generally, we show that locality can be an important factor to sensibly speed-up learning approaches and kernel methods, differently from other recent techniques that tend to dismiss local information in order to improve scalability.

AB In recent years a variety of approaches in classifying the sentiment polarity of texts have been proposed. While in the majority of approaches the determination of subjectivity or polarity-related term features is at the center, the number of publicly available dictionaries is rather limited. In this paper, we investigate the performance of combining lexical resources with machine learning-based classifier for the task of sentiment classification. We systematically analyze four different English and three different German polarity dictionaries as a resources for a sentiment-based feature selection. The evaluation results show that smaller but more controlled dictionaries used for feature selection perform within a SVM-based classification setup equally good compared to the biggest available resources.

AB Recognizing objects based on their appearance (visual recognition) is one of the most significant abilities of many living creatures. In this study, recent advances in the area of automated object recognition are reviewed; the authors specifically look into several learning frameworks to discuss how they can be utilized in solving object recognition paradigms. This includes reinforcement learning, a biologically-inspired machine learning technique to solve sequential decision problems and transductive learning, and a framework where the learner observes query data and potentially exploits its structure for classification. The authors also discuss local and global appearance models for object recognition, as well as how similarities between objects can be learnt and evaluated.

AB This work explores the design of mammography-based machine learning classifiers (MLC) and proposes a new method to build MLC for breast cancer diagnosis. We massively evaluated MLC configurations to classify features vectors extracted from segmented regions (pathological lesion or normal tissue) on craniocaudal (CC) and/or mediolateral oblique (MLO) mammography image views, providing BI-RADS diagnosis. Previously, appropriate combinations of image processing and normalization techniques were applied to reduce image artifacts and increase mammograms details. The method can be used under different data acquisition circumstances and exploits computer clusters to select well performing MLC configurations. We evaluated 286 cases extracted from the repository owned by HSJ-FMUP, where specialized radiologists segmented regions on CC and/or MLO images (biopsies provided the golden standard). Around 20,000 MLC configurations were evaluated, obtaining classifiers achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.996 when combining features vectors extracted from CC and MLO views of the same case.

AB Support vector machines (SVM) perform good generalization ability on various application fields in practice, especially for small sample problems. But in the SVM research on handwritten character recognition, it is substantially slower in test phase than neural networks with same generalization performance. So simplifying SVM without loss in generalization ability is important research in order to improve the classification speed of SVM. In this paper, we use both iterative learning method and constructing reduced vector set to simplify the decision function of SVM. Computational results show that our method can simplify SVM effectively, and for SVM with Gaussian kernel, it cam be implemented easily.

AB In the process of human learning, teachers always play an important role. However, for most of the existing machine learning method, the role of teachers is seldom considered. Recently, Vapnik introduced an advanced learning paradigm called Learning Using Privileged Information(LUPI) to include the elements of human teaching in machine learning. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, the superiority of LUPI over the classical learning paradigm has received preliminary proof. In this paper, on the basis of existing work for LUPI, we introduce the privileged information into the modeling of L-1 support vector machine(SVM). Compared with the existing research of LUPI with L-2 SVM, the new method has the advantage of spending less time on tuning model parameters and the additional benefits of performing feature selection in the training process. Experiments on the digit recognition problem validate the effectiveness of our method.

AB Computational localization of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs, also termed as motif instances) in DNA sequences greatly helps biologists in saving experimental cost and time for motif discovery. The task can be formulated as feature-based object location identification problem, which is remarkably different from traditional pattern recognition tasks. This paper aims to develop a machine learning approach for TFBSs location prediction through feature-based classifiers. Some specific features are extracted to characterize and distinguish the TFBSs from random k-mers. Then, a sampling technique is employed to generate dummy positives in the feature space for achieving better prediction performance. Three learner models are examined and a simple ensemble method is adopted in our classifiers design. Experimental results on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed techniques have good potential for conserved motif detections. Comparative studies indicate that the extreme learning machine-based ensemble classifier outperforms the other learner models in terms of overall prediction accuracy and computational complexity.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM), as an emergent technique for training feed-forward neural networks, has shown good performances on various learning domains. This paper investigates the impact of random weights during the training of ELM. It focuses on the randomness of weights between input and hidden layers, and the dimension change from input layer to hidden layer. The direct motivation is to verify as to whether during the training of ELM, the randomly assigned weights exert some positive effects. Experimentally we show that for many classification and regression problems, the dimension increase caused by random weights in ELM has a performance better than the dimension increase caused by some kernel mappings. We assume that via the random transformation, output-samples are more concentrate than input-samples which will make the learning more efficient.

AB In domains with limited data, such as ballistic impact, prior researches have proven that the optimization of artificial neural models is an efficient tool for improving the performance of a classifier based on MultiLayer Perceptron. In addition, this research aims to explore, in the ballistic domain, the optimization of other machine learning strategies and their application in regression problems. Therefore, this paper presents an optimization methodology to use with several approaches of machine learning in regression problems, maximizing the limited dataset and locating the best network topology and input vector of each network model. This methodology is tested in real regression scenarios of ballistic impact with different artificial neural models, obtaining substantial improvement in all the experiments. Furthermore, the quality stage, based on criteria of information theory, enables the determination of when the complexity of the network design does not penalize the fit over the data and thereby the selection of the best neural network model from a series of candidates. Finally, the results obtained show the relevance of this methodology and its application improves the performance and efficiency of multiple machine learning strategies in regression scenarios.

   System Models
AB Textual specification documents do not represent a suitable starting point for software development. This issue is due to the inherent problems of natural language such as ambiguity, impreciseness and incompleteness. In order to overcome these shortcomings, experts derive analysis models such as requirements models. However, these models are difficult and costly to create manually. Furthermore, the level of abstraction of the models is too low, thus hindering the automated transformation process. We propose a novel approach which uses high abstraction requirements models in the form of Object System Models (OSMs) as targets for the transformation of natural language specifications in conjunction with appropriate text mining and machine learning techniques. OSMs allow the interpretation of the textual specification based on a small set of facts and provide structural and behavioral information. This approach will allow both (1) the enhancement of minimal specifications, and in the case of comprehensive specifications (2) the determination of the most suitable structure of reusable requirements.

TI Mitigating Blackouts via Smart Relays: A Machine Learning Approach

   relays; support vector machine (SVM) classification
ID SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, we investigate the protective relays used in electric power systems and their role in large-scale blackouts. After reviewing the state of the art, to mitigate future blackouts, we propose a newmachine learning approach for protective relays based on binary hypothesis testing, support vector machines (SVMs), and communications between the protective relays and the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), which we call smart protective relays. The goal of smart relays is to classify and discriminate the normal conditions from fault conditions via local measurements. It is shown that the proposed SVM-based smart relays can detect the location of an initial fault using local current, voltage, real power, and reactive power measurements, and by monitoring these metrics, they can make a correct decision even when the state of the system changes after some equipment failure. We show that by making an intelligent decision on whether and when to trip, and communicating the changes observed to SCADA for fast and intelligent decision making, SVM-based smart relays have the potential to mitigate large-scale blackouts and confine them to much smaller areas. By deploying SVM-based smart relays only at relatively few locations where they have the highest probability to be tripped incorrectly, the probability of cascade of failures and a blackout can be greatly reduced.

AB In this paper, we consider the single-machine setup times scheduling with the effects of learning and deterioration. By the effects of learning and deterioration, we mean that the actual processing time of a job depends not only on the processing times of the jobs already processed but also on its scheduled position. The setup times are proportional to the length of the already processed jobs, i.e., the setup times are past-sequence-dependent (p-s-d). We show that the problems to minimize the makespan, the total completion time, and the sum of the delta th (d >= 0) power of job completion times are polynomially solvable. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem, the maximum lateness minimization problem, and the number of tardy jobs minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions.

   Canal systems; Water management; Machine learning
AB Anticipating, or forecasting near-term irrigation demands is a requirement for improved management of conveyance and delivery systems. The most important component of a forecasting regime for irrigation is a simple, yet reliable, approach for forecasting crop water demands, which in this paper is represented by the reference or potential evapotranspiration (ETo). In most cases, weather data in the area is limited to a reduced number of variables measured, therefore current or future ETo estimation is restricted. This paper summarizes the results of testing of two proposed forecasting ETo schemes under the mentioned conditions. The first or "direct" approach involved forecasting ETo using historically computed ETo values. The second or "indirect" approach involved forecasting the required weather parameters for the ETo calculation based on historical data and then computing ETo. An statistical machine learning algorithm, the Multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (MVRVM) is applied to both of the forecastings schemes. The general ETo model used is the 1985 Hargreaves Equation which requires only minimum and maximum daily air temperatures and is thus well suited to regions lacking more comprehensive climatic data. The utility and practicality of the forecasting methodology is demonstrated with an application to an irrigation project in Central Utah. To determine the advantage and suitability of the applied algorithm, another learning machine, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), is used for comparison purposes. The robustness and stability of the proposed schemes are tested by the application of the bootstrap analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Algorithm performance evaluation is so entrenched in the machine learning community that one could call it an addiction. Like most addictions, it is harmful and very difficult to give up. It is harmful because it has serious limitations. Yet, we have great faith in practicing it in a ritualistic manner: we follow a fixed set of rules telling us the measure, the data sets and the statistical test to use. When we read a paper, even as reviewers, we are not sufficiently critical of results that follow these rules. Here, we will debate what are the limitations and how to best address them. This article may not cure the addiction but hopefully it will be a good first step along that road.

Since there is a consistent growth in the volume of digital documents, both on the internet and within organizations, the need to classify them into categories is obvious. In this paper we used `bag-of-words' technique to represent the tender documents. The dataset was prepared and fed into Weka toolkit. Classification was implemented by Naive Bayes classifier using 10-folds cross validation technique. The machine resulted in classifying the tender documents with an accuracy of 77.36% by technology category and 67.2% by lab's name.

AB Active learning is mainly to select a part of unlabelled samples from a big dataset. The selected samples are then submitted to domain experts to label and added to the training set. Suppose that the price of labeling samples is far more than the computational cost of training algorithms, we propose a scheme of active learning based on support vector machines, which follows the traditionally inductive learning model of general-specific. In terms of the number of selected samples, the training cost, and the generalization ability, a comparison with some existing active learning algorithms is conducted. The advantages and disadvantages are demonstrated experimentally.

AB Labor-intensity of resource quality assessment is a bottleneck for content management in metadata-driven health information portals. This research proposes an adaptive attribute-based approach to assist informed judgments when assessing the quality of online information resources. It employs intelligent learning techniques to predict values of resource quality attributes based on previous value judgments encoded in resource metadata descriptions. The proposed approach is implemented as an intelligent quality attribute learning component of a portal's content management system. This paper introduces the required machine learning procedures for the implementation of the component. Its prediction performance was evaluated via a series of machine learning experiments, which demonstrated the feasibility and the potential usefulness of the proposed approach.

AB In this work we present a large scale comparison study for the major machine learning models for time series forecasting. Specifically, we apply the models on the monthly M3 time series competition data (around a thousand time series). There have been very few, if any, large scale comparison studies for machine learning models for the regression or the time series forecasting problems, so we hope this study would fill this gap. The models considered are multilayer perceptron, Bayesian neural networks, radial basis functions, generalized regression neural networks (also called kernel regression), K-nearest neighbor regression, CART regression trees, support vector regression, and Gaussian processes. The study reveals significant differences between the different methods. The best two methods turned out to be the multilayer perceptron and the Gaussian process regression. In addition to model comparisons, we have tested different preprocessing methods and have shown that they have different impacts on the performance.

AB Recent advances in computing and developments in technology have facilitated the routine collection and storage of medical data that can be used to support medical decisions. However, in most countries, there is a first need for collecting and organizing patient's data in digitized form. Then, the collected data are to be analyzed in order for a medical decision to be drawn, whether this involves diagnosis, prediction, course of treatment, or signal and image analysis. In this paper, India centric dataset is used for Heart disease diagnosis. The correct diagnosis performance of the automatic diagnosis system is estimated by using classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity analysis. The study shows that, the SVM with Sequential Minimization Optimization learning algorithm have better choice for medical disease diagnosis application.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Shape optimization is a widely used technique in the design phase of a product. Current ongoing improvement policies require a product to fulfill a series of conditions from the perspective of mechanical resistance, fatigue, natural frequency, impact resistance, etc. All these conditions are translated into equality or inequality restrictions which must be satisfied during the optimization process that is necessary in order to determine the optimal shape. This article describes a new method for shape optimization that considers any regular shape as a possible shape, thereby improving on traditional methods limited to straight profiles or profiles established a priori. Our focus is based on using functional techniques and this approach is, based on representing the shape of the object by means of functions belonging to a finite-dimension functional space. In order to resolve this problem, the article proposes an optimization method that uses machine learning techniques for functional data in order to represent the perimeter of the set of feasible functions and to speed up the process of evaluating the restrictions in each iteration of the algorithm. The results demonstrate that the functional approach produces better results in the shape optimization process and that speeding up the algorithm using machine learning techniques ensures that this approach does not negatively affect design process response times.

AB Many transient simulations spend a significant portion of the overall runtime solving a linear system. A wide variety of preconditioned linear solvers have been developed to quickly and accurately solve different types of linear systems, each having options to customize the preconditioned solver for a given linear system. Transient simulations may produce significantly different linear systems as the simulation progresses due to special events occurring that make the linear systems more difficult to solve or the model moving closer to a state of equilibrium where the linear systems are easier to solve.
   Machine learning algorithms provide the ability to dynamically select the preconditioned linear solver for each linear system produced by a simulation. We can generate databases by computing attributes for each linear system, physical attributes for the transient simulation, computational attributes, and running times for a set of preconditioned solvers on each linear system. Machine learning algorithms can then use these databases to generate classifiers capable of dynamically selecting a preconditioned solver for each linear system given a set of attributes. This allows us to quickly and accurately compute each transient simulation using different preconditioned solvers throughout the simulation. This also provides the potential to produce speedups in comparison with using a single preconditioned solver for an entire transient simulation.

AB In the fashion retail industry, a versatile sales forecasting system is crucial for fashion retailers. In order to avoid stock-out and maintain a high inventory fill rate, fashion retailers require specific and accurate sales forecasting systems. In this study, a hybrid method based on extreme learning machine model with the adaptive metrics of inputs is proposed for improving sales forecasting accuracy. The adaptive metrics of inputs can solve the problems of amplitude changing and trend determination, and reduce the effect of the overfitting of networks. The proposed algorithms are validated using real POS data of three fashion retailers selling high-ended, medium and basic fashion items in Hong Kong. It was found that the proposed model is practical for fashion retail sales forecasting and outperforms the auto-regression (AR), artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) models.

AB Permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM) are appealing candidates for many high-performance applications such as robotics, machine tools and other electrical propulsion system because of their attractive characteristics. PMSM have advantages of high power density, high torque-to-inertia ratio, and high electrical efficiency. However, the main disadvantage of PMSM is the torque ripples. Therefore, the study of how to compensate the torque ripples so as to improve the tracking performance of PMSM is very meaningful and necessary. In this paper, we focus on the control of a non-sinusoidal permanent magnet synchronous machine. First, we compare the various methods which to reduce the torque ripple. Then, we built a basic PMSM model. After that the Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithm is applied to compensate the torque ripple, and improve the tracking performance of the PMSM. The effectiveness of using ILC method to reduce torque ripple is demonstrated by simulink results.

AB Multi document analysis has been a field of interest for decades and is still being actively researched until today. One example of such analysis could be for the task of multi document summarization which is meant to represent the concise description of the original documents. In this paper, we will focus on some special properties that multi document articles hold, specifically news articles. Information across news articles reporting on the same story are often related. Cross-document structure theory (CST) gives several relationships between pairs of sentences from different documents. Among them, we focus on four relations namely "Identity", "Overlap", "Subsumption", and "Description". Our aim is to automatically identify these CST relationships. We applied three machine learning techniques, i.e. SVM, neural network and our proposed case-based reasoning (CBR) model. Comparison between these techniques shows that the proposed CBR model yields better results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces a new time-dependent learning effect model into a single-machine scheduling problem. The time-dependent learning effect means that the processing time of a job is assumed to be a function of total normal processing time of jobs scheduled in front of it. In most related studies, the actual job processing time is assumed to be a function of its scheduled position when the learning effect is considered in the scheduling problem. In this paper, the actual processing time of a job is assumed to be proportionate to the length and position of the already scheduled jobs. It shows that the addressed problem remains polynomially solvable for the objectives, i.e., minimization of the total completion time and minimization of the total weighted completion time. It also shows that the shortest processing time (SPT) rule provides the optimum sequence for the addressed problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel framework for microcalcification clusters (MCs) detection in mammograms. The proposed framework has three main parts: (1) first, MCs are enhanced by using a simple-but-effective artifact removal filter and a well-designed high-pass filter; (2) thereafter, subspace learning algorithms can be embedded into this framework for subspace (feature) selection of each image block to be handled; and (3) finally, in the resulted subspaces, the MCs detection procedure is formulated as a supervised learning and classification problem, and in this work, the twin support vector machine (TWSVM) is developed in decision-making of MCs detection. A large number of experiments are carried out to evaluate and compare the MCs detection approaches, and the effectiveness of the proposed framework is well demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ANNOTATION
AB The main goal of Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) is to capture biomedical phenomena from textual data by extracting relevant entities and information or relations between biomedical entities such as proteins and genes. Previous research was focussed on extracting only binary relations, but in recent times the focus is shifted towards extracting more complex relations in the form of bio-molecular events that may include several entities or other relations. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) to extract the arguments of bio-molecular events. The overall task involves identification of event triggers from texts, classification of them into some predefined categories and determining the arguments of these events. We identify and implement a set of features in the forms of statistical and linguistic features that represent various morphological, syntactic and contextual information. Experiments on the benchmark setup of BioNLP 2009 shared task show the recall, precision and F-measure values of 45.75%, 78.93% and 57.91%, respectively.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) was proposed as a new class of learning algorithm for single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) much faster than the traditional gradient-based learning strategies. However, ELM random determination of the input weights and hidden biases may lead to non-optimal performance, and it might suffer from the overfitting as the learning model will approximate all training samples well. In this paper, a hybrid approach is proposed based on Group Search Optimizer (GSO) strategy to select input weights and hidden biases for ELM algorithm, called GSO-ELM. In addition, we evaluate the influence of different forms of handling members that fly out of the search space bounds. Experimental results show that GSO-ELM approach using different forms of dealing with out-bounded members is able to achieve better generalization performance than traditional ELM in real benchmark datasets.

AB A real-time machine learning-based fire smoke detection method that can be incorporated with a automatic monitoring system for early alerts is proposed by this paper. The successive processing steps of our real-time algorithm are using the motion segmentation algorithm to register the possible smoke position in a video and then analyze the spectral, spatial and motion orientation characteristics of the smoke regions in the image sequences. Characterization of smoke was carried out by calculating arithmetic mean and standard deviation from the extracted feature vectors, and the non-linear classification method using support vector machine is applied to give the potential fire smoke candidate region. Then, the continuously adaptive mean shift (CAMSHIFT) vision tracking algorithm is employed to provide feedback of the fire smoke real-time position at a high frame rate. Experimental results in a variety of conditions show the proposed support vector machine-based fire smoke detection method is capable of detecting fire smoke reliably and robustly.

DE Brain-machine interface; Event-related potential; P300 speller
AB Brain machine interface (BMI) is an interface that uses brain activity to interact with computer-based devices. We introduce a BMI system using electroencephalography (EEG) and the reinforcement learning method, in which event-related potential (ERP) represents a reward reflecting failure or success of BMI operations. In experiments, the P300 speller task was conducted with adding the evaluation process where subjects counted the number of times the speller estimated a wrong character. Results showed that ERPs were evoked in the subjects observing wrong output. Those were estimated by using a support vector machine (SVM) which classified data into two categories. The overall accuracy of classification was approximately 58%. Also, a simulation using the reinforcement learning method was conducted. The result indicated that discriminant accuracy of SVM may improve with the learning process in a way that optimizes the constituent parameters.

AB Image super-resolution is the process to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. In this paper, an efficient image super-resolution approach based on the recent development of extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. We aim at reconstructing the high-frequency components containing details and fine structures that are missing from the low-resolution images. In the training step, high-frequency components from the original high-resolution images as the target values and image features from low-resolution images are fed to ELM to learn a model. Given a low-resolution image, the high-frequency components are generated via the learned model and added to the initially interpolated low-resolution image. Experiments show that with simple image features our algorithm performs better in terms of accuracy and efficiency with different magnification factors compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

ID PARALLELISM
AB Thread mapping is an appealing approach to efficiently exploit the potential of modern chip-multiprocessors. However, efficient thread mapping relies upon matching the behavior of an application with system characteristics. In particular, Software Transactional Memory (STM) introduces another dimension due to its runtime system support. In this work, we propose a dynamic thread mapping approach to automatically infer a suitable thread mapping strategy for transactional memory applications composed of multiple execution phases with potentially different transactional behavior in each phase. At runtime, it profiles the application at specific periods and consults a decision tree generated by a Machine Learning algorithm to decide if the current thread mapping strategy should be switched to a more adequate one. We implemented this approach in a state-of-the-art STM system, making it transparent to the user. Our results show that the proposed dynamic approach presents performance improvements up to 31% compared to the best static solution.

ID SERIES
AB A model for short-term forecasting of continuous time series has been developed. This model binds the use of both statistical and machine learning methods for short-time forecasting of continuous time series of solar radiation. The prediction of this variable is needed for the integration of photovoltaic systems in conventional power grids. The proposed model allows us to manage not only the information in the time series, but also other important information supplied by experts. In a first stage, we propose the use of statistical models to obtain useful information about the significant information for a continuous time series and then we use this information, together with machine learning models, statistical models and expert knowledge, for short-term forecasting of continuous time series. The results obtained when the model is used for solar radiation series show its usefulness.

AB Many mobile robot navigation methods use, among others, laser scanners, ultrasonic sensors, vision cameras for detecting obstacles and following paths. However, humans use only visual (e.g. eye) information for navigation. In this paper, we propose a mobile robot control method based on machine learning algorithms which use only camera vision. To efficiently define the state of the robot from raw images, our algorithm uses image-processing and feature selection steps to choose the feature subset for a neural network and uses the output of the neural network learned through supervised learning. The output of the neural network uses the state of a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn obstacle-avoiding and path-following strategies using camera vision image. The algorithm is verified by two experiments, which are line tracking and obstacle avoidance.

AB The improvement and exploitation of a number of prominent Data Mining techniques in numerous real-world application areas (e.g. Industry, Healthcare and Bioscience) has led to the utilization of such techniques in machine learning environments, in order to extract useful pieces of information of the specified data and support decision making. Throughout this study, a comprehensive techniques' comparison is performed upon a fairly large set of data consisting of real medical incidents of men with the diagnosis of prostate cancer which are receiving medical treatment. 40 patients, suffered previously with prostate cancer and without undergone radiation therapy, were examined for therapy change after already receiving medical treatment. Six parameters were measured for eight subsequent quartiles to assess the patient state and its treatment outcome. Specifically, with the aim of the open source WEKA environment, the given data is tested with a number of machine learning and classification techniques in order to compare the performance of the chosen algorithms upon the practitioner's decision of a potential therapy change.

DE Extreme learning machine (ELM); Neural network kernel
AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a neural network architecture in which hidden layer weights are randomly chosen and output layer weights determined analytically. We interpret ELM as an approximation to a network with infinite number of hidden units. The operation of the infinite network is captured by neural network kernel (NNK). We compare ELM and NNK both as part of a kernel method and in neural network context. Insights gained from this analysis lead us to strongly recommend model selection also on the variance of ELM hidden layer weights, and not only on the number of hidden units, as is usually done with ELM. We also discuss some properties of ELM, which may have been too strongly interpreted in previous works.

AB A method for the sparse multikernel support vector regression machines is presented. The proposed method achieves a high accuracy versus complexity ratio and allows the user to adjust the complexity of the resulting models. The sparse representation is guaranteed by limiting the number of training data points for the support vector regression method. Each training data point is selected based on its influence on the accuracy of the model using the active learning principle. A different kernel function is attributed to each training data point, yielding multikernel regressor. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated on several examples and the experiments show the advantages of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Scheduling; Past-sequence-dependent; Learning effect; Single-machine
AB This paper considers a single-machine scheduling model with past-sequence-dependent setup times and a general learning effect. It develops a general model with setup times and learning effect considerations where the actual processing time of a job is not only a function of the total actual processing time of the jobs already processed, but also a function of the job's scheduled position. The paper shows that the single-machine scheduling problems to minimize the makespan and the sum of the kth power of completion times are polynomially solvable under the proposed model. It further shows that the problems to minimize the total weighted completion time and the maximum lateness are polynomially solvable under certain conditions.

AB Machine learning uses experience to improve its performance. Using Machine Learing, to locate the nodes in wireless sensor network. The basic idea is that: the network area is divided into several equal portions of small grids, each gird represents a certain class of Machine Learning algorithm. After Machine Learning algorithm has learnt the parameters using the known beacon nodes, it can classify the unknown nodes' location classes, and further determine their coordinates. For the SVM OneAgainstOne Location Algorithm, the results of simulation show that it has a high localization accuracy and a better tolerance for the ranging error, while it doesn't require a high beacon node ratio. For the SVM Decision Tree Location Algorithm, the results show that this algorithm is not affected seriously by coverage holes, it is suitable for the network environment of nonuniformity distribution or existing coverage holes.

AB This paper presents an empirical study on machine learning-based sentiment analysis. Though polarity classification has been extensively studied at different document-structure levels (e.g. document, sentence, words), little work has been done investigating feature selection methods and subjectivity resources. We systematically analyze four different English subjectivity resources for the task of sentiment polarity identification. While the results show that the size of dictionaries clearly correlate to polarity-based feature coverage, this property does not correlate to classification accuracy. Using polarity-based feature selection, considering a minimum amount of prior polarity features, in combination with SVM-based machine learning methods exhibits the best performance (acc = 84.1, f1 = 83.9), in comparison to the classical approaches on polarity identification. Based on the findings of the English-based experimental setup, a new German subjectivity resource is proposed for the task of German-based sentiment analysis. The results of the experiments show, with f1 = 85.9 its good adaptability to the new domain.

AB To holding the accuracy detection of Hyper-Sphere Support Vector Machine(HSVM) online, the model need retraining with all samples and the time would be longer with more samples. The hyper-sphere classification model with optimal Separation are proposed with the advantages of optimal separation hyper-plane and support vector data description (SVDD) to improve the train efficiency on line. After analysis the support vector set of the proposed model with new training samples increase, an on line incremental learning algorithm based on Sequential Minimal Optimization(SMO) is proposed which reduced the initial training samples and improve the SMO learning algorithm with new samples, then the training efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated in the application of the simulation experiment.

AB The concepts of deteriorating jobs and learning effects have been individually studied in many scheduling problems. This note considers a single-machine scheduling problem with deteriorating jobs and learning effects. All of the jobs have a common (but unknown) due date. The objective is to minimize the sum of the weighted earliness, tardiness and due-date penalties. An O(n(3)) algorithm is proposed to optimally solve the problem with deteriorating jobs and job-dependent learning effect. Besides, an O(n log n) algorithm is provided to solve the problem with deteriorating jobs and job-independent learning effect.

ID SAMPLE COMPRESSION; ALGORITHMS; AVERAGES
AB We investigate classifiers in the sample compression framework that can be specified by two distinct sources of information: a compression set and a message string of additional information. In the compression setting, a reconstruction function specifies a classifier when given this information. We examine how an efficient redistribution of this reconstruction information can lead to more general classifiers. In particular, we derive risk bounds that can provide an explicit control over the sparsity of the classifier and the magnitude of its separating margin and a capability to perform a margin-sparsity trade-off in favor of better classifiers. We show how an application to the set covering machine algorithm results in novel learning strategies. We also show that these risk bounds are tighter than their traditional counterparts such as VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity-based bounds that explicitly take into account the hypothesis class complexity. Finally, we show how these bounds are able to guide the model selection for the set covering machine algorithm enabling it to learn by bound minimization.

AB Inverse lithography technology (ILT) synthesizes photomasks by solving an inverse imaging problem through optimization of an appropriate functional. Much effort on ILT is dedicated to deriving superior masks at a nominal process condition. However, the lower k(1) factor causes the mask to be more sensitive to process variations. Robustness to major process variations, such as focus and dose variations, is desired. In this paper, we consider the focus variation as a stochastic variable, and treat the mask design as a machine learning problem. The stochastic gradient descent approach, which is a useful tool in machine learning, is adopted to train the mask design. Compared with previous work, simulation shows that the proposed algorithm is effective in producing robust masks.

AB Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been proposed for generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward networks which need not be neuron-like and perform well in both regression and classification applications. In this brief, we propose an ELM with adaptive growth of hidden nodes (AG-ELM), which provides a new approach for the automated design of networks. Different from other incremental ELMs (I-ELMs) whose existing hidden nodes are frozen when the new hidden nodes are added one by one, in AG-ELM the number of hidden nodes is determined in an adaptive way in the sense that the existing networks may be replaced by newly generated networks which have fewer hidden nodes and better generalization performance. We then prove that such an AG-ELM using Lebesgue p-integrable hidden activation functions can approximate any Lebesgue p-integrable function on a compact input set. Simulation results demonstrate and verify that this new approach can achieve a more compact network architecture than the I-ELM.

Many of this class of compounds are potentially mutagenic or even carcinogenic, and the assessment and prediction of their mutagenicity are of practical importance because mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are toxicological end points that play major roles in the genesis of cancer and tumor. Quantitative structure-activity relationship of a homogeneous set of mutagenicity data (TA98 + S9), which was comprehensively compiled from literature, was developed by four machine learning methods, namely hierarchical support vector regression (HSVR), support vector machine, radial basis function neural networks, and genetic function algorithm. The predictions by these models are in good agreement with the experimental observations for those molecules in the training set (n = 97, r(2) = 0.78-0.93, q(2) = 0.64-0.93, root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.51-0.90, SD = 0.34-0.56) and the test set (n = 25, r(2) = 0.73-0.85, RMSE = 0.65-0.85, SD = 0.33-0.51). In addition, several validation criteria were adopted to verify those generated models, and a set of outliers was deliberately selected to examine the robustness of these four predictive models (n = 14, r(2) = 0.35-0.84, RMSE = 0.55-1.21, SD = 0.25-0.72). Finally, various cross-comparison schemes, namely forward comparisons, backward comparisons, and most common molecule comparisons, with assorted published predictive models were carried out. Our results indicate that the HSVR model is the most accurate, robust, and consistent and can be employed as a tool for predicting mutagenicity of aromatic amines.

AB Early lithographic hotspot detection has become increasingly important in achieving lithography-friendly designs and manufacturability closure. Fast physical verification tools employing pattern matching or machine learning techniques have emerged as great options for detecting hotspots in the early design stages. In this work, we propose a characterization methodology that provides measurable quantification of a given hotspot detection tool's capability to capture a previously seen or unseen hotspot pattern. Using this methodology, we conduct a side-by-side comparison of two hotspot detection methods-one using pattern matching and the other based on machine learning. The experimental results reveal that machine learning classifiers are capable of predicting unseen samples but may mispredict some of its training samples. On the other hand, pattern matching-based tools exhibit poorer predictive capability but guarantee full and fast detection on all their training samples. Based on these observations, we propose a hybrid detection solution that utilizes both pattern matching and machine learning techniques. Experimental results show that the hybrid solution combines the strengths of both algorithms and delivers improved detection accuracy while sacrificing little runtime efficiency.

ID SELECTION
AB This paper presents an accurate hybrid method for fault classification in a series compensated transmission line. The proposed scheme uses discrete wavelet transform in combination with extreme learning machine for fault classification. Instantaneous value of current signal is measured from the relaying end of the transmission line for one cycle duration from the inception of fault. Discrete wavelet transform is used to decompose the signal and extract certain features from it. The feature set is then normalized and best features are selected from the total feature set by forward feature selection method. Selected features are then fed as an input to the extreme learning machine for fault classification. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique, it is tested on a 400 kV, 300 km series compensated transmission line for all the ten type of fault using MATLAB/SIMULINK. A wide range of simulation condition is taken to generate the train and test pattern. Simulation result indicates that the proposed approach is robust, fast in learning and classifies the fault very accurately.

AB Development of an intelligent software system to analyze and score Corporate Sustainability reports within the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework has been well foreseen and in a high demand since the latest framework's publication in 2000's. As the number of reporting organizations and published reports is increasing exponentially, development of a software system to automate the daunting manual scoring process seems even more vital. We describe our preliminary efforts and the related results of our efforts in building such software through application of machine learning approach to text classification. Conduction of earlier training on thousands of sample documents to construct machine learning based classifiers inductively is our primary approach to solving this problem.

AB This paper introduces the current machine learning approach to solving spatial modeling problems in the domain of landslide susceptibility assessment. The latter is introduced as a classification problem, having multiple (geological, morphological, environmental etc.) attributes and one referent landslide inventory map from which to devise the classification rules. Three different machine learning algorithms were compared: Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and Logistic Regression. A specific area of the Fruska Gora Mountain (Serbia) was selected to perform the entire modeling procedure, from attribute and referent data preparation/processing, through the classifiers' implementation to the evaluation, carried out in terms of the model's performance and agreement with the referent data. The experiments showed that Support Vector Machines outperformed the other proposed methods, and hence this algorithm was selected as the model of choice to be compared with a common knowledge-driven method - the Analytical Hierarchy Process - to create a landslide susceptibility map of the relevant area. The SVM classifier outperformed the AHP approach in all evaluation metrics (kappa index, area under ROC curve and false positive rate in stable ground class). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we present an effective and efficient computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on principle component analysis (PCA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) to assist the task of thyroid disease diagnosis. The CAD system is comprised of three stages. Focusing on dimension reduction, the first stage applies PCA to construct the most discriminative new feature set. After then, the system switches to the second stage whose target is model construction. ELM classifier is explored to train an optimal predictive model whose parameters are optimized. As we known, the number of hidden neurons has an important role in the performance of ELM, so we propose an experimental method to hunt for the optimal value. Finally, the obtained optimal ELM model proceeds to perform the thyroid disease diagnosis tasks using the most discriminative new feature set and the optimal parameters. The effectiveness of the resultant CAD system (PCA-ELM) has been rigorously estimated on a thyroid disease dataset which is taken from UCI machine learning repository. We compare it with other related methods in terms of their classification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PCA-ELM outperforms other ones reported so far by 10-fold cross-validation method, with the mean accuracy of 97.73% and with the maximum accuracy of 98.1%. Besides, PCA-ELM performs much faster than support vector machines (SVM) based CAD system. Consequently, the proposed method PCA-ELM can be considered as a new powerful tools for diagnosing thyroid disease with excellent performance and less time.

In this model, job processing times are defined by functions of their starting times and positions in the sequence. The window location and size, along with the associated job schedule that minimizes a certain cost function, are to be determined. This function is made up of costs associated with the window location, window size, earliness and tardiness. We show that the problem remains polynomially solvable under the proposed model.

AB The performance of eight machine learning classifiers were compared with three aphasia related classification problems. The first problem contained naming data of aphasic and non-aphasic speakers tested with the Philadelphia Naming Test. The second problem included the naming data of Alzheimer and vascular disease patients tested with Finnish version of the Boston Naming Test. The third problem included aphasia test data of patients suffering from four different aphasic syndromes tested with the Aachen Aphasia Test. The first two data sets were small. Therefore, the data used in the tests were artificially generated from the original confrontation naming data of 23 and 22 subjects, respectively. The third set contained aphasia test data of 146 aphasic speakers and was used as such in the experiments. With the first and the third data set the classifiers could successfully be used for the task, while the results with the second data set were less encouraging. However, based on the results, no single classifier performed exceptionally well with all data sets, suggesting that the selection of the classifier used for classification of aphasic data should be based on the experiments performed with the data set at hand.

   Error-driven
AB Transliteration is a common translation method when named entities are introduced into another language. Direct orthographical mapping (DOM) approach is successfully applied in machine transliteration by segmenting a word according to syllables and then mapping them directly into target language without considering its pronunciation. The paper studies the performance of two-stage machine transliteration based on Conditional Random Fields. To reduce the amount of computation in model training, we propose an error-driven learning by dividing the training data into several groups and training the transliteration model step by step based on the error prediction data until the performance doesn't increase or the limitation of the computer. Experiments on data of NEWS2011 show that error-driven model training reduces computational complexity and saves the time of model training. Compared to the combining transliteration model, our transliteration system increases the accuracy of top-1 output with 0.06, reaching 0.652.

Among the techniques applied to tackle the problem, machine vision based approaches have advantages due to its flexibility, accuracy, and economy. This paper describes a real-time steel inspection system, which investigated the usage of support vector machine (SVM) and multiple kernel learning (MKL) method. Based on the preliminary experimental results, the proposed method demonstrates the efficiency in detection and recognition steel surface detects. It is shown that the advanced classification methods such as SVM and MKL are applicable for the real-time steel surface inspection system.

AB The Support Vector Machine is an acknowledged powerful tool for building classifiers, but it lacks flexibility, in the sense that the kernel is chosen prior to learning. Multiple Kernel Learning enables to learn the kernel, from an ensemble of basis kernels, whose combination is optimized in the learning process. Here, we propose Composite Kernel Learning to address the situation where distinct components give rise to a group structure among kernels. Our formulation of the learning problem encompasses several setups, putting more or less emphasis on the group structure. We characterize the convexity of the learning problem, and provide a general wrapper algorithm for computing solutions. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of our method on multi-channel data where groups correspond to channels.

AB Recently, the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms has proven to be of great practical value in solving a variety of engineering problems including the prediction of failure, fault, and defect-proneness as the space system software becomes complex. One of the most active areas of recent research in ML has been the use of ensemble classifiers. How ML techniques (or classifiers) could be used to predict software faults in space systems, including many aerospace systems is shown, and further use ensemble individual classifiers by having them vote for the most popular class to improve system software fault-proneness prediction. Benchmarking results on four NASA public datasets show the Naive Bayes classifier as more robust software fault prediction while most ensembles with a decision tree classifier as one of its components achieve higher accuracy rates.

AB Linear support vector machines (SVMs) have become one of the most prominent classification algorithms for many natural language learning problems such as sequential labeling tasks. Even though the L-2-regularized SVMs yields slightly more superior accuracy than L-1-SVM, it produces too much near but non zero feature weights. In this paper, we present a cutting-weight algorithm to guide the optimization process of L-2-SVM into sparse solution. To verify the proposed method, we conduct the experiments with three well-known sequential labeling tasks and one dependency parsing task. The result shows that our method achieved at least 400% feature parameter reduction rates in comparison to the original L-2-SVM, with almost no change in accuracy and training times. In terms of run time efficiency, our method is faster than the original L-2-regularized SVMs at least 20% in all tasks.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new scheduling model in which both two-agent and time-based learning effect exist simultaneously. Two agents compete to perform their respective jobs on a common single machine and each agent has his own criterion to optimize. The time-based learning effect of a job is assumed to be a function of the total normal processing time of the jobs scheduled in front of the job. The objective is to minimize the total completion time of the first agent with the restriction that the makespan of the second agent cannot exceed a given upper bound. The optimal properties of the problems are given, and then the optimal polynomial time algorithm is proposed to solve the scheduling problem.

AB In this paper, a condition monitoring and fault diagnosis method for rotating machineries using machine learning technologies including artificial neural network (ANNs) and support vector machine (SVMs) is described. The vibration signal is acquired from gearbox used in local power generation industry for analysis of potential defects. Wavelet packet transforms (WPT) and time domains statistical are used to extraction features, and the compensation distance evaluation technique (CDET) is applied to select optimal feature via sensitivities ranking. A comparative experiment study of the efficiency of ANN and SVM in predication of failure is carried out. The results reveal that the proposed feature selection and machine learning algorithms could be effectively used automatic diagnosis of gear faults.

AB We developed a three-dimensional (3D) segmentation method for transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images, which is based on longitudinal image registration and machine learning. Using longitudinal images of each individual patient, we register previously acquired images to the new images of the same subject. Three orthogonal Gabor filter banks were used to extract texture features from each registered image. Patient-specific Gabor features from the registered images are used to train kernel support vector machines (KSVMs) and then to segment the newly acquired prostate image. The segmentation method was tested in TRUS data from five patients. The average surface distance between our and manual segmentation is 1.18 +/- 0.31 mm, indicating that our automatic segmentation method based on longitudinal image registration is feasible for segmenting the prostate in TRUS images.

AB We examine the problem of classifying biological sequences, and in particular the challenge of generalizing results to novel input data. We observe that the high-dimensionality of sequence data representations results in an extremely sparsely populated input space. This motivates a need for regularization (a form of inductive bias), in order to achieve generalization. We discuss regularization in the context of regular neural networks, deep belief networks and support vector machines, and provide experimental results for these architectures. Our results support the importance of using an effective regularization method and identify which methods work well on a real-world dataset.

AB In a recent paper, Lee and Wu [W.-C. Lee, C.-C. Wu, A note on single-machine group scheduling problems with position-based learning effect, Appl. Math. Model. 33 (2009) 21592163] proposed a new group scheduling learning model where the learning effect not only depends on the job position, but also depends on the group position. They investigate the makespan and the total completion time minimization problems on a single-machine. As for the total completion time minimization problem, they assumed that the numbers of jobs in each group are the same and the group normal setup and the job normal processing times are agreeable. Under the assumption conditions, they showed that the total completion time minimization problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time solution. However, the assumption conditions for the total completion time minimization problem do not reflect actual practice in many manufacturing processes. Hence, in this note, we propose other agreeable conditions and show that the total completion time minimization problem remains polynomially solvable under the agreeable conditions.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new learning method for composite function wavelet neural networks (CFWNN) by combining the differential evolution (DE) algorithm with extreme learning machine (ELM), in short, as CWN-E-ELM. The recently proposed CFWNN trained with ELM (CFWNN-ELM) has several promising features. But the CFWNN-ELM may have some redundant nodes due to the number of hidden nodes assigned a priori and the input weight matrix and the hidden node parameter vector randomly generated once and never changed during the learning phase. The introduction of DE into CFWNN-ELM is to search for the optimal network parameters and to reduce the number of hidden nodes used in the network. Simulations on several artificial function approximations, real-world data regressions and a chaotic signal prediction problem show some advantages of the proposed CWN-E-ELM. Compared with CFWNN-ELM, CWN-E-ELM has a much more compact network size and Compared with several relevant methods, CWN-E-ELM is able to achieve a better generalization performance.

AB We present a method for optimizing transition state theory dividing surfaces with support vector machines. The resulting dividing surfaces require no a priori information or intuition about reaction mechanisms. To generate optimal dividing surfaces, we apply a cycle of machine-learning and refinement of the surface by molecular dynamics sampling. We demonstrate that the machine-learned surfaces contain the relevant low-energy saddle points. The mechanisms of reactions may be extracted from the machine-learned surfaces in order to identify unexpected chemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we show that the machine-learned surfaces significantly increase the transmission coefficient for an adatom exchange involving many coupled degrees of freedom on a (100) surface when compared to a distance-based dividing surface.

AB Dimension reduction has been widely employed to deal with the curse of dimensionality before training supervised learning such as neural network and this framework combining dimension reduction and supervised learning algorithms is called as two-stage approach. However during the process of this approach, the system has to store original data and pre-process data simultaneously which will increase the complexity and re-compute the SVD when the new data arrive. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel learning algorithm for high-dimension large-scale data, by combining a new incremental dimension reduction with feed-forward neural network training simultaneously, called Incremental Projection Vector Machine (IPVM). With new samples arriving, instead of re-computing the full rank SVD of the whole dataset, an incremental method is applied to update the original SVD. It is suitable for high-dimension large-sample data for the singular vectors are updated incrementally. Experimental results showed that the proposed one-stage algorithm IPVM was faster than two-stage learning approach such as SVD+BP and SVD+ELM, and performed better than conventional supervised algorithms.

AB Mosheiov and Sidney (2003) showed that the makespan minimization problem with job-dependent learning effects can be formulated as an assignment problem and solved in O(n(3)) time. We show that this lproblem can be solved in O(nlog n) time by sequencing the jobs according to the shortest processing time (SPT) order if we utilize the observation that the job-dependent learning rates are correlated with the level of sophistication of the jobs and assume that these rates are bounded from below. The optimality of the SPT sequence is also preserved when the job-dependent learning rates are inversely correlated with the level of sophistication of the jobs and bounded from above.

AB The dynamic load characteristics have significant impact on the power flow, transient stability computation, voltage stability calculation of the power system, and so on. Noticing that traditional mechanism loads model has difficulty in precisely describing the dynamic characteristics of synthetic load, this paper presents a non-mechanism dynamic load model based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The Power Fault Recorder and Measurement System (PFRMS) is used to obtain data for load modeling. Take voltage and real/reactive power with different time delay as inputs, and take real/reactive power as output, train the ELM using the samples formed by fault data, the real power model and reactive power model are established respectively. The number of hidden layer nodes which has impact on the ELM model is also discussed. Dynamic simulation experiment is conducted at power system dynamic simulation laboratory. The simulation result shows that the ELM load model is simple and flexible, its parameters are easy to be identified. The ELM load model can describe the dynamic load characteristics accurately.

AB Measuring image similarity is a central topic in computer vision. In this paper, we propose to measure image similarity by learning from the online Flickr image groups. We do so by: Choosing 103 Flickr groups, building a one-versus-all multiclass classifier to classify test images into a group, taking the set of responses of the classifiers as features, calculating the distance between feature vectors to measure image similarity. Experimental results on the Corel dataset and the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset show that our approach performs better on image matching, retrieval, and classification than using conventional visual features. To build our similarity measure, we need one-versus-all classifiers that are accurate and can be trained quickly on very large quantities of data. We adopt an SVM classifier with a histogram intersection kernel. We describe a novel fast training algorithm for this classifier: the Stochastic Intersection Kernel MAchine (SIKMA) training algorithm. This method can produce a kernel classifier that is more accurate than a linear classifier on tens of thousands of examples in minutes.

ID SPEED
AB Physical damage to property and crops caused by unanticipated wind gusts is a well understood phenomenon. Predicting its occurrence continues to be a challenge for meteorologists and climatologists. Various approaches to gust occurrence model building have been proposed. The very nature of the event is problematic because of its brief duration following a rapid change of state in wind velocity that immediately precedes it. Events classified as wind gusts have a typical duration of less than 20 s and are often much shorter. The rapidly accelerating wind velocity preceding them is often not apparent until the gust occurs. They come quickly, occur suddenly, and then end as abruptly as they began.
   Observations of 2000 gust events were made during the research to which this paper refers. These observations indicated a mean interval of 3.2 min between the beginning and end of wind velocity change and a noticeable linear progression in the acceleration pattern. It was also noted that state changes regularly occur, often over only seconds in time. In combination, these factors pose both a sampling and a data interpretation challenge, making reliable prediction difficult. This paper describes some new research undertaken to investigate methods of wind gust measurement and prediction. In particular, a machine-learning approach is taken to determine a satisfactory analytical process and to produce meaningful and useful results. An algorithm for use with real-time climate data collection and analysis is proposed, with a description of its implementation. Real-time data sampling provides input for this study using terrestrial sensor telemetry. Near-ground truth data are recorded independent of geostrophic upper atmosphere conditions.

AB This paper provides a continuation of the idea presented by Yin et al. [Yin et al., Some scheduling problems with general position-dependent and time-dependent learning effects, Inform. Sci. 179 (2009) 2416-2425]. For each of the following three objectives, total weighted completion time, maximum lateness and discounted total weighted completion time, this paper presents an approximation algorithm which is based on the optimal algorithm for the corresponding single-machine scheduling problem and analyzes its worst-case bound. It shows that the single-machine scheduling problems under the proposed model can be solved in polynomial time if the objective is to minimize the total lateness or minimize the sum of earliness penalties. It also shows that the problems of minimizing the total tardiness, discounted total weighted completion time and total weighted earliness penalty are polynomially solvable under some agreeable conditions on the problem parameters.

AB In the area of bio-informatics, large amount of data is harvested with functional and genetic features of proteins. The structure of protein plays an important role in its biological and genetic functions. In this study, we propose a protein structure prediction scheme based novel learning algorithms - the extreme learning machine and the Support Vector Machine using multiple kernel learning, The experimental validation of the proposed approach on a publicly available protein data set shows a significant improvement in performance of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy of classification of protein folds using multiple kernels where multiple heterogeneous feature space data are available. The proposed method provides the higher recognition ratio as compared to other methods reported in previous studies.

AB The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient approach to improve medical diagnosis performance of breast cancer. First, the medical dataset of breast cancer is selected from UCI Machine Learning Repository. After that, the standardization and normalization of datasets are pre-processing procedure. Secondly, the proposed approach combines support vector machine with artificial immune system as the medical diagnosis classifier. The results of diagnosis are identified and the rates of classification accuracy are evaluated. A simple artificial immune algorithm with various affinity criteria is investigated for comparison. Furthermore, the grid-search with 10-fold cross-validation is applied to choose two parameters of C and gamma for AIS-based machine learning classifier. Through grid-search technique, the proposed classifier could yield the best results.

AB Machine learning techniques have been widely used in drug discovery and development, particularly in the areas of cheminformatics, bioinformatics and other types of pharmaceutical research. It has been demonstrated they are suitable for large high dimensional data, and the models built with these methods can be used for robust external predictions. However, various problems and challenges still exist, and new approaches are in great need. In this Chapter, the authors will review the current development of machine learning techniques, and especially focus on several machine learning techniques they developed as well as their application to model building, lead discovery via virtual screening, integration with molecular docking, and prediction of off-target properties. The authors will suggest some potential different avenues to unify different disciplines, such as cheminformatics, bioinformatics and systems biology, for the purpose of developing integrated in silico drug discovery and development approaches.

AB Sales promotions have become in recent years a paramount issue in the marketing strategies of many companies, and they have even more relevance in the present economic situation. Currently, the empirical models, aimed at assessing consumers behavior in response to certain sales promotions activities such as temporary price reductions, are receiving growing attention in this relevant research field, due to two reasons mainly: (1) the complexity of the interactions among the different elements incorporated inside promotions campaigns attracts growing attention; and (2) the increased availability of electronic records on sales history. Hence, it will become important that the performance description and comparison among all available machine learning promotion models, as well as their design parameters selection, will be performed using a robust and statistically rigorous procedure, while keeping functionality and usefulness. In this paper, we first propose a simple nonparametric statistical tool, based on the paired bootstrap resampling, to allow an operative result comparison among different learning-from-samples promotional models. Secondly, we use the bootstrap statistical description to evaluate the models in terms of average and scatter measurements, for a more complete efficiency characterization of the promotional sales models. These statistical characterizations allow us to readily work with the distribution of the actual risk, in order to avoid overoptimistic performance evaluation in the machine learning based models. We also present the analysis performed to determinate whether the figure of merit has a significant impact on final result, together with an in depth design parameter selection to optimize final results during the promotion evaluation using statistical learning techniques. No significant difference was obtained in terms of figure of merit choice, and Mean Absolute Error was selected for performance measurement. As a summary, the applied technique allows clarifying the design of the promotional sales models for a real database (milk category), according to the influence of the figure of merit used for design parameters selection, showing the robustness of the machine learning techniques in this setting. Results obtained in this paper will be subsequently applied, and presented in the companion paper, devoted to a more detailed quality analysis, to evaluate four well-known machine learning algorithms in real databases for two categories with different promotional behavior.

AB The use of photometric solids into both real time and photorealistic rendering allows designers and computer artists to enhance easily the quality of their images. Lots of such data are available from lighting societies since they allow these societies to easily present the luminance distribution of their often complex ligthing systems. When accuracy is required the amount of discretized luminance directions and the number of photometric solids that have to be used increase considerably the memory requirements and reduce the algorithm efficiency. In this paper we describe and compare two machine learning approaches used for approximating any photometric solid: an artificial neural network and ECON (Equi-Correlated Network Algorithm). By applying these two approaches on a large set of real photometric distribution data, we were able to show that one of them provides generally a better approximation of the original distribution.

AB This paper presents a new supervised learning scheme, which uses hybrid information i.e. global and local object information, for accurate identification and classification at considerably high speed both in training and testing phase. The first contribution of this paper is a unique image representation using bidirectional two-dimensional PCA and Ferns style approach to represent global and local information, respectively, of an object. Secondly, the application of extreme learning machine supports reliable recognition with minimum error and learning speed approximately thousands of times faster than traditional neural networks. The proposed method is capable of classifying various datasets in a fraction of second compared to other modern algorithms that require at least 2-3s per image [14]. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, a four-stage Support vector machine (SVM) based multiagent ensemble learning approach is proposed for credit risk evaluation. In the First stage, the initial dataset is divided into two independent Subsets: training subset (in-sample data) and testing Subset (out-of-sample data) for training and verification purposes. In the second stage. different SVM learning paradigms with much dissimilarity are constructed as intelligent agents for credit risk evaluation In the third stage, multiple individual SVM agents are trained using training subsets and the corresponding evaluation results are also obtained In the final stage, all individual results produced by multiple SVM agents in the previous stage are aggregated into an ensemble result. In particular, the impact of the diversity of individual intelligent agents on the generalization performance of the SVM-based multiagent ensemble learning system is examined and analyzed For illustration. one corporate credit card application approval dataset is used to verify the effectiveness of the SVM-based multiagent ensemble learning system.

AB The meaning of such verb-noun combinations as take care, undertake work, pay attention can be generalized as DO what is designated by the noun. Likewise, the meaning of make a decision, provide support, write a letter can be generalized as MAKE what is designated by the noun. These generalizations represent the meaning of certain groups of verb-noun combinations. We use supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the meanings DO, MAKE, BEGIN, and CONTINUE of previously unseen verb-noun pairs. We evaluate the performance of the applied algorithms on a training set using 10-fold cross-validation technique. The learnt models have also been evaluated on an independent test set and the predictions have been checked manually to determine the accuracy of the classifiers. The obtained results show that supervised machine learning methods achieve significant accuracy and can be used for semantic annotation of verb-noun combinations.

AB Efforts to develop algorithms that can robustly detect the cessation of seizure activity within scalp EEGs are now underway. Such algorithms can facilitate novel clinical applications such as the estimation of a seizure's duration: the delivery of therapies designed to mitigate postictal period symptoms: or detection of the presence of status epilepticus. In this article, we present and evaluate a novel, machine learning-based method for detecting the termination of electrographic seizure activity. When tested on 133 seizures from a public database, our method successfully detected the end of 132 seizures within 10.3 +/- 5.5 seconds of the time determined by an electroencephalographer to represent the electrographic end of seizure. Furthermore, by pairing our seizure end detector with a previously published seizure onset detector, we could automatically estimate the duration of 85% of test electrographic seizures within a 15-second error margin compared with electroencephalographer determinations.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) as an emergent technology has shown its good performance in regression applications as well as in large dataset (and/or multi-label) classification applications The ELM theory shows that the hidden nodes of the generalized single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) which need not be neuron alike can be randomly generated and the universal approximation capability of such SLFNs can be guaranteed This paper further studies ELM for classification in the aspect of the standard optimization method and extends ELM to a specific type of generalized SLFNs support vector network. This paper shows that (1) under the ELM learning framework SVM s maximal margin property and the minimal norm of weights theory of feedforward neural networks are actually consistent (2) from the standard optimization method point of view ELM for classification and SVM are equivalent but ELM has less optimization constraints due to its special separability feature (3) as analyzed in theory and further verified by the simulation results ELM for classification tends to achieve better generalization performance than traditional SVM ELM for classification is less sensitive to user specified parameters and can be implemented easily (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB Scene classification is useful for automatic organization of personal digital photographs or visual guidance of robots, but it is a time consuming and labor-intensive task to label adequate examples to train robust classifiers. Active learning is a key technique to reduce human-labeling burden by exploring an optimal subset from unlabeled data. In this paper we use a batch mode incremental and active learning framework to construct scene classification models. In traditional batch examples selection methods, there often exists redundancy information between these top informative examples. To alleviate the impact of redundancy, we employ two effective batch selection strategies which one is called multi-pool based BvSB and the other is called K-centroid cluster BvSB, experimental results with widely used 15 scene and UIUC-sports datasets demonstrated that our scheme can get better results than that only using BvSB measurement which does not considering redundancy. In order to improve efficiency, batch mode incremental support vector machines are employed. With the incremental learning scheme, the training process of active learning is much more efficient than that using all the selected examples to retrain the classification models in each round.

AB The purpose of this study is to organize issue-oriented interdisciplinary curricula, in which natural language processing, and machine learning-based automatic classification are combined. The recent explosion in scientific knowledge due to the rapid advancement of academia and society makes it difficult for learners and educators to recognize the overall picture of syllabus. In addition, the growing amount of interdisciplinary research makes it harder for learners to find subjects that suit their needs from the syllabi. In an attempt to present clear directions to suitable subjects, issue-oriented interdisciplinary curricula are expected to be more efficient in learning and education. However, these curricula normally require all the syllabi be manually categorized in advance, which is generally time consuming. Thus, this emphasizes the importance of developing efficient methods for (semi-) automatic syllabus classification in order to accelerate syllabus retrieval. In this paper, we introduce design and implementation of an issue-oriented automatic syllabus classification. Preliminary experiments using more than 850 engineering syllabi of the University of Tokyo show that our proposed syllabus classification system obtains sufficient accuracy.

AB The automatic detection and classification of epileptic EEG are significant in the evaluation of patients with epilepsy. This paper presents a new EEG classification approach based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) and nonlinear dynamical features. The theory of nonlinear dynamics has been a powerful tool for understanding brain electrical activities. Nonlinear features extracted from EEG signals such as approximate entropy (ApEn), Hurst exponent and scaling exponent obtained with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) are employed to characterize interictal and ictal EEGs. The statistics indicate that the differences of those nonlinear features between interictal and ictal EEGs are statistically significant. The ELM algorithm is employed to train a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) with EEG nonlinear features. The experiments demonstrate that compared with the backpropagation (BP) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM), the performance of the ELM is better in terms of training time and classification accuracy which achieves a satisfying recognition accuracy of 96.5% for interictal and ictal EEG signals.

AB Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems traditionally find images within a database that are similar to query image using low level features, such as colour histograms. However, this requires a user to provide an image to the system. It is easier for a user to query the CBIR system using search terms which requires the image content to be described by semantic labels. However, finding a relationship between the image features and semantic labels is a challenging problem to solve. This paper aims to discover semantic labels for facial features for use in a face image retrieval system. Face image retrieval traditionally uses global face-image information to determine similarity between images. However little has been done in the field of face image retrieval to use local face-features and semantic labelling. Our work aims to develop a clustering method for the discovery of semantic labels of face-features. We also present a machine learning based face-feature localization mechanism which we show has promise in providing accurate localization.

AB In scheduling problems with learning effects, most researches assume that processing times are deterministic. This paper considers a single-machine scheduling problem with a position-based learning effect and fuzzy processing times, simultaneously. The position-based learning effect of a job is assumed to be a function of its position. The processing times are considered to be triangular fuzzy numbers. A polynomial time algorithm is proposed for the problem where the objective is to minimize the total completion time. The solution procedure is based on applying the shortest processing time rule to triangular fuzzy processing times. Computational results show that our model gives better results than the model ignoring the uncertainty.

AB We describe an intramolecularly polarisable multipolar electrostatic potential model for ethanol, which acts as a pilot molecule for this proof-of-concept study. We define atoms via the partitioning prescribed by quantum chemical topology (QCT). A machine learning method called Kriging is employed to capture the way atomic multipole moments vary upon conformational change. The multipole moments predicted by the Kriging models are used in the calculation of atom-atom electrostatic interaction energies. Charge transfer is treated in the same way as dipolar polarisation and the polarisation of higher rank multipole moments. This method enables the development of a new and more accurate force field.

AB Studies on scheduling with learning considerations have recently become important. Most studies focus on single-machine settings. However, numerous complex industrial problems can be modeled as flowshop scheduling problems. This paper thus focuses on minimizing the makespan in an m-machine permutation flowshop with learning considerations. This paper proposes a dominance theorem and a lower bound to accelerate the branch-and-bound algorithm for seeking the optimal solution. This paper also adapts four well-known existing heuristic algorithms to yield the near-optimal solutions. Eventually, the performances of all the algorithms proposed in this paper are reported for small and large job-sized problems. The computational experiments indicate that the branch-and-bound algorithm can solve problems of up to 18 jobs within a reasonable amount of time, and the heuristic algorithms are quite accurate with a mean error percentage of less than 0.1%.

DT Article; Book Chapter
AB The applications of machine learning algorithms to the analysis of data sets of DNA sequences are very important. The present chapter is devoted to the experimental investigation of applications of several machine learning algorithms for the analysis of a JLA data set consisting of DNA sequences derived from non-coding segments in the junction of the large single copy region and inverted repeat A of the chloroplast genome in Eucalyptus collected by Australian biologists. Data sets of this sort represent a new situation, where sophisticated alignment scores have to be used as a measure of similarity. The alignment scores do not satisfy properties of the Minkowski metric, and new machine learning approaches have to be investigated. The authors' experiments show that machine learning algorithms based on local alignment scores achieve very good agreement with known biological classes for this data set. A new machine learning algorithm based on graph partitioning performed best for clustering of the JLA data set. Our novel k-committees algorithm produced most accurate results for classification. Two new examples of synthetic data sets demonstrate that the authors' k-committees algorithm can outperform both the Nearest Neighbour and k-medoids algorithms simultaneously.

AB Most social bookmarking systems allow users to assign a set of suitable tags to web resources. The tags annotated in such a collaborative way are used for categorizing, navigating, and searching the gathered information. This kind of classification system (a.k.a. folksonomy) is a defining characteristic of Web 2.0 services. Many social bookmarking systems also provide a tag recommendation service, which could promote and facilitate the tag annotation process as well as keep the folksonomy well maintained. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to personalized and content-specific tag recommendation in social bookmarking. For each bookmarking activity consisting of a user and a resource, a set of candidate keywords are extracted from three kinds of information sources: the resource description, previously annotated tags to the same resource, and previously annotated tags by the same person. Each candidate keyword is assigned its importance values calculated from past annotation patterns. Then, a machine learning technique is applied to merge the importance information and ranking the candidate keywords. In our experiments, various machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, and nearest neighbor methods were evaluated by diverse measures, i.e., AUC (area under the ROC curve), recall, precision, F1-measure, and NDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain) as well as learning and inference time. The evaluation was performed on the ECML PKDD discovery challenge 2009 dataset obtained from a real social bookmarking system. As a result, artificial neural networks outperformed other methods in terms of recommendation accuracy at an acceptable response time. Our approach also performs better than the best result of the challenge especially in top recommendations.

AB Studies show that dementia is highly age-associated. Early diagnosis can help patient to receive timely treatment and slow down the deterioration. This paper proposed a hierarchical double layer structure with multi-machine learning algorithms for early stage dementia diagnosis. Fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and probability neural networks (PNNs) were adopted to give initial diagnosis at based-layer, and then Bayesian networks (BNs) was used to make a final diagnosis at top-layer. Diagnosis results, "proposed treatment" and "no treatment required" can be used to provide self-testing or secondary dementia diagnosis to medical institutions. To demonstrate the reliability of the proposed system, a clinical data provided by the Cheng Kung University Hospital was examined. The accuracy of this system was as high as 83%, which showed that the proposed system was reliable and flexible.

AB A learning machine, called a clustering interpreting probabilistic associative memory (CIPAM), is proposed. CIPAM consists of a clusterer and an interpreter. The clusterer is a recurrent hierarchical neural network of unsupervised processing units (UPUs). The interpreter is a number of supervised processing units (SPUs) that branch out from the clusterer. Each processing unit (PU), UPU or SPU, comprises "dendritic encoders" for encoding inputs to the PU, "synapses" for storing resultant codes, a "nonspiking neuron" for generating inhibitory graded signals to modulate neighboring spiking neurons, "spiking neurons" for computing the subjective probability distribution (SPD) or the membership function, in the sense of fuzzy logic, of the label of said inputs to the PU and generating spike trains with the SPD or membership function as the firing rates, and a masking matrix for maximizing generalization. While UPUs employ unsupervised covariance learning mechanisms, SPUs employ supervised ones. They both also have unsupervised accumulation learning mechanisms. The clusterer of CIPAM clusters temporal and spatial data. The interpreter interprets the resultant clusters, effecting detection and recognition of temporal and hierarchical causes.

AB Recently, scheduling with learning effects has received growing attention. A well-known learning model is called 'sum-of processing-times-based learning' where the actual processing time of a job is a non-increasing function of the jobs already processed. However, the actual processing time of a given job drops to zero precipitously when the normal job processing times are large. Motivated by this observation, this paper develops a truncated learning model in which the actual job processing time not only depends on the processing times of the jobs already processed but also depends on a control parameter. The use of the truncated function is to model the phenomenon that the learning of a human activity is limited. In this paper, some single-machine scheduling problems can be solved in polynomial time. Besides, the error bounds are also provided for the problems to minimise the maximum lateness and the total weighted completion time.

AB Background: Most machine learning approaches only provide a classification for binary responses. However, probabilities are required for risk estimation using individual patient characteristics. It has been shown recently that every statistical learning machine known to be consistent for a nonparametric regression problem is a probability machine that is provably consistent for this estimation problem.
   Objectives: The aim of this paper is to show how random forests and nearest neighbors can be used for consistent estimation of individual probabilities.
   Methods: Two random forest algorithms and two nearest neighbor algorithms are described in detail for estimation of individual probabilities. We discuss the consistency of random forests, nearest neighbors and other learning machines in detail. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate the validity of the methods. We exemplify the algorithms by analyzing two well-known data sets on the diagnosis of appendicitis and the diagnosis of diabetes in Pima Indians.
   Results: Simulations demonstrate the validity of the method. With the real data application, we show the accuracy and practicality of this approach. We provide sample code from R packages in which the probability estimation is already available. This means that all calculations can be performed using existing software.
   Conclusions: Random forest algorithms as well as nearest neighbor approaches are valid machine learning methods for estimating individual probabilities for binary responses. Freely available implementations are available in R and may be used for applications.

AB A critical machine identification algorithm is proposed for the job shop scheduling problem in which the total tardiness must be minimized. An optimization-based procedure is devised to learn the distribution characteristics of critical machines in a specific scheduling instance. The proposed simulated annealing algorithm optimizes the scheduling problem after the capacity constraints for each machine are modified. A genetic algorithm based on combined dispatching rules is designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

AB We describe a technique to measure the locations of phase interfaces (bed levels) in industrial processes, such as in sedimentation or separation. The measurement approach is based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) type technology in which the conductivity distribution of the object is estimated based on the current-voltage data of the measurement device. In this article we discuss a novel probe technique that uses machine learning methodology to estimate the bed levels. We also introduce a way to prune the set of injection and measurement electrodes to the bare minimum which makes the measurement device considerably simpler - and consequently, cheaper - to build. Results obtained through a simulation study are reported and discussed.

AB We propose a method for learning interactions among objects when intermediate state information is not available. Learning is accomplished by observing a given sequence of actions on different objects. We have selected the Incredible Machine game as a suitable domain for analyzing and learning object interactions. We first present how behaviors are represented by finite state machines using the given input. Then, we analyze the impact of the knowledge about relations on the over all performance. Our analysis includes four different types of input: a knowledge base including part relations; spatial information; temporal information; and spatio-temporal information. We show that if a knowledge base about relations is provided, learning is accomplished to a desired extent. Our analysis also indicates that the spatio-temporal approach is superior to the spatial and the temporal approaches and gives close results to that of the knowledge-based approach.

ID EMBOLISM
AB Pulmonary embolism is a common cardiovascular emergency with about 600,000 cases occurring annually and causing approximately 200,000 deaths in the US. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the reference standard for PE diagnosis, but the interpretation of these large image datasets is made complex and time consuming by the intricate branching structure of the pulmonary vessels, a myriad of artifacts that may obscure or mimic PEs, and suboptimal bolus of contrast and inhomogeneities with the pulmonary arterial blood pool. To meet this challenge, several approaches for computer aided diagnosis of PE in CTPA have been proposed. However, none of these approaches is capable of detecting central PEs, distinguishing the pulmonary artery from the vein to effectively remove any false positives from the veins, and dynamically adapting to suboptimal contrast conditions associated the CTPA scans. To overcome these shortcomings, it requires highly efficient and accurate identification of the pulmonary trunk. For this very purpose, in this paper, we present a machine learning based approach for automatically detecting the pulmonary trunk. Our idea is to train a cascaded AdaBoost classifier with a large number of Haar features extracted from CTPA image samples, so that the pulmonary trunk can be automatically identified by sequentially scanning the CTPA images and classifying each encountered sub-image with the trained classifier. Our approach outperforms an existing anatomy-based approach, requiring no explicit representation of anatomical knowledge and achieving a nearly 100% accuracy tested on a large number of cases.

DE Video quality assessment (VQA); temporal variations; spatial quality;
   machine learning
AB Objective video quality assessment (VQA) is the use of computational models to predict the video quality in line with the perception of the human visual system (HVS). It is challenging due to the underlying complexity, and the relatively limited understanding of the HVS and its intricate mechanisms. There are two important issues regarding VQA: (a) the temporal factors apart from the spatial ones also need to be considered, (b) the contribution of each factor and their interaction to the overall video quality needs to be determined. In this paper, we attempt to tackle the first issue by utilizing the variation of spatial quality along the temporal axis. The second issue is addressed by the use of machine learning; we believe this to be more convincing since the relationship between the factors and the overall quality is derived via training with substantial ground truth (i.e. subjective scores). Experiments conducted using two publicly available video databases show the effectiveness of the proposed full-reference metric in comparison to the relevant existing VQA metrics.

   PERFORMANCE
AB Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control a computer application by brain activity as acquired (e.g., by EEG). In our classic machine learning approach to BCIs, the participants undertake a calibration measurement without feedback to acquire data to train the BC! system. After the training, the user can control a BCI and improve the operation through some type of feedback. However, not all BCI users are able to perform sufficiently well during feedback operation. In fact, a non-negligible portion of participants (estimated 15%-30%) cannot control the system (a BCI illiteracy problem, generic to all motor-imagery-based BCIs). We hypothesize that one main difficulty for a BCI user is the transition from offline calibration to online feedback. In this work, we investigate adaptive machine learning methods to eliminate offline calibration and analyze the performance of 11 volunteers in a BCI based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. We present an adaptation scheme that individually guides the user. It starts with a subject-independent classifier that evolves to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts continuously. These initial runs use supervised techniques for robust coadaptive learning of user and machine. Subsequent runs use unsupervised adaptation to track the features' drift during the session and provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, without any offline calibration, six users, including one novice, obtained good performance after 3 to 6 minutes of adaptation. More important, this novel guided learning also allows participants with BCI illiteracy to gain significant control with the BCI in less than 60 minutes. In addition, one volunteer without sensorimotor idle rhythm peak at the beginning of the BCI experiment developed it during the course of the session and used voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application.

AB In the past several years, a host of new technologies have made it possible to visualize single molecules within cells and organisms (Raj et al., Nat Methods 5:877-879, 2008; Pare et al., Curr Biol 19:2037- 2042, 2009; Lu and Tsourkas, Nucleic Acids Res 37:e100, 2009; Femino et al., Science 280:585-590, 1998; Rodriguez et al., Semin Cell Dev Biol 18:202-208, 2007; Betzig et al., Science 313:1642-1645, 2006; Rust et al., Nat Methods 3:793-796, 2006; Fusco et al., Curr Biol 13:161-167, 2003). Many of these are based on fluorescence, either fluorescent proteins or fluorescent dyes coupled to a molecule of interest. In many applications, the fluorescent signal is limited to a few pixels, which poses a classic signal processing problem: how can actual signal be distinguished from background noise?
   In this chapter, I present a MATLAB (Math Works (2010) MATLAB. Retrieved from http://www.mathworks.com) software suite designed to work with these single-molecule visualization technologies (Rifkin (2010) spotFinding Suite. http://www.biology.ucsd.edu/labs/rifkin/software.html). It takes images or image stacks from a fluorescence microscope as input and outputs locations of the molecules. Although the software was developed for the specific application of identifying single mRNA transcripts in fixed specimens, it is more general than this and can be used and/or customized for other applications that produce localized signals embedded in a potentially noisy background. The analysis pipeline consists of the following steps: (a) create a gold-standard dataset, (b) train a machine-learning algorithm to classify image features as signal or noise depending upon user defined statistics, (c) run the machine-learning algorithm on a new dataset to identify mRNA locations, and (d) visually inspect and correct the results.

AB Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is known as the key rate-limiting enzyme responsible for regulating free fatty acids (FFAs) metabolism in adipose tissue. Recently, HSL has been found to be useful in the treatment of diabetes so the discovery of new HSL inhibitors (HSLIs) is of interest. Methods for the prediction of HSLIs are highly desired to facilitate the design of novel diabetes therapeutic agents because limited knowledge exists concerning the mechanism and three dimensional (3D) structure of hormone-sensitive lipase. We have explored several machine teaming methods (support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and C4.5 decision tree (C4.5 DT)) to predict desirable HSLIs from a comprehensive set of known HSLIs and non-HSLIs. Our prediction system was tested using 252 compounds (123 HSLIs and 1.29 non-HSLIs) and these are significantly more diverse in chemical structure than those in other studies. The recursive feature elimination selection method was used to improve the prediction accuracy and to select the molecular descriptors responsible for distinguishing HSLIs and non-HSLIs. Prediction accuracies were 85.7%-90.5% for HSLIs, 63.2%-68.4% for non-HSLIs, and 75.0%-80.0% for all structures based on three kinds of machine teaming methods using an independent validation set. SVM gave the best total accuracy of 80.0% for all the structures. This work suggests that machine teaming methods such as SVM are useful to predict the potential HSLIs among unknown sets of compounds and to characterize the molecular descriptors associated with HSLIs.

AB For a long time, the clinical management of antiretroviral drug resistance was based on sequence analysis of the HIV genome followed by estimating drug susceptibility from the mutational pattern that was detected. The large number of anti-HIV drugs and HIV drug resistance mutations has prompted the development of computer-aided genotype interpretation systems, typically comprising rules handcrafted by experts via careful examination of in vitro and in vivo resistance data. More recently, machine learning approaches have been applied to establish data-driven engines able to indicate the most effective treatments for any patient and virus combination. Systems of this kind, currently including the Resistance Response Database Initiative and the EuResist engine, must learn from the large data sets of patient histories and can provide an objective and accurate estimate of the virological response to different antiretroviral regimens. The EuResist engine was developed by a European consortium of HIV and bioinformatics experts and compares favorably with the most commonly used genotype interpretation systems and HIV drug resistance experts. Next-generation treatment response prediction engines may valuably assist the HIV specialist in the challenging task of establishing effective regimens for patients harboring drug-resistant virus strains. The extensive collection and accurate processing of increasingly large patient data sets are eagerly awaited to further train and translate these systems from prototype engines into real-life treatment decision support tools.

AB Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) is the most established protein separation method used in expression proteomics. Despite the existence of sophisticated software tools, 2-DE gel image analysis still remains a serious bottleneck. The low accuracies of commercial software packages and the extensive manual calibration that they often require for acceptable results show that we are far from achieving the goal of a fully automated and reliable, high-throughput gel processing system. We present a novel spot detection and quantification methodology which draws heavily from unsupervised machine-learning methods. Using the proposed hierarchical machine learning-based segmentation methodology reduces both the number of faint spots missed (improves sensitivity) and the number of extraneous spots introduced (improves precision). The detection and quantification performance has been thoroughly evaluated and is shown to compare favorably (higher F-measure) to a commercially available software package (PDQuest). The whole image analysis pipeline that we have developed is fully automated and can be used for high-throughput proteomics analysis since it does not require any manual intervention for recalibration every time a new 2-DE gel image is to be analyzed. Furthermore, it can be easily parallelized for high performance and also applied without any modification to prealigned group average gels.

AB The face-to-face interactions of infants and their parents are a model system in which critical communicative abilities emerge. We apply machine learning methods to explore the predictability of infant and mother behavior during interaction with an eye to understanding the preconditions of infant intentionality. Overall, developmental changes were most evident when the probability of specific behaviors was examined in specific interactive contexts. Mother's smiled predictably in response to infant smiles, for example, and infant smile initiations become more predictable over developmental time. Analysis of face-to-face interaction - a tractable model system - promise to pave the way for the construction of virtual and physical agents who are able to interact and develop.

AB This article introduces a general single-machine setup times scheduling model with learning effect and deteriorating jobs simultaneously which is a generalisation of some existing models in the literature. The setup times are proportional to the length of the already processed jobs, i.e. the setup times are past-sequence-dependent (p-s-d). By the effects of learning and deterioration, we mean that the actual processing time of a job depends not only on the starting time of the job but also on its scheduled position. The article shows that the problems to minimise the makespan, sum of the kth power of completion times, total lateness and sum of earliness penalties (with common due date) are polynomially solvable under the proposed model. It further shows that the problems to minimise total weighted completion time, maximum lateness, maximum tardiness, total tardiness and total weighted earliness penalties (with common due date) are polynomially solvable under certain conditions.

AB Metabolomics is increasingly becoming an important field. The fundamental task in this area is to measure and interpret complex time and condition dependent parameters such as the activity or flux of metabolites in cells, their concentration, tissues elements and other biosamples. The careful study of all these elements has led to important insights in the functioning of metabolism. Recently, however, there is a growing interest towards an integrated approach to studying biological systems. This is the main goal in Systems Biology where a combined investigation of several components of a biological system is thought to produce a thorough understanding of such systems. Biological circuits are complex to model and simulate and many efforts are being made to develop models that can handle their intrinsic complexity. A significant part of biological networks still remains unknown even though recent technological developments allow simultaneous acquisition of many metabolite measurements. Metabolic networks are not only structurally complex but behave also in a stochastic fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to express structure and handle uncertainty to construct complete dynamics of these networks. In this paper we describe how stochastic modeling and simulation can be performed in a symbolic-statistical machine learning (ML) framework. We show that symbolic ML deal with structural and relational complexity while statistical ML provides principled approaches to uncertainty modeling. Learning is used to analyze traces of biochemical reactions and model the dynamicity through parameter learning, while inference is used to produce stochastic simulation of the network.

AB This paper describes a procedure based on the use of manifold learning algorithms to visualize periodic -or nearly periodic- time series produced by processes with different underlying dynamics. The proposed approach is done in two steps: a feature extraction stage, where a set of descriptors in the frequency domain is extracted, and a manifold learning stage that finds low dimensional structures in the feature space and obtains projections on a low dimensional space for visualization. This approach is applied on vibration data of an electromechanical rotating machine to visualize different vibration conditions under two kinds of asymmetries, using four state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithms for comparison purposes. In all cases, the methods yield consistent results and produce insightful visualizations, suggesting future developments and application in engineering problems.

AB The functions of proteins in living organisms are related to their 3-D structure, which is known to be ultimately determined by their linear sequence of amino acids that together form these macromolecules. It is, therefore, of great importance to be able to understand and predict how the protein 3D-structure arises from a particular linear sequence of amino acids. In this paper we report the application of Machine Learning methods to predict, with high values of accuracy, the secondary structure of proteins, namely alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are intermediate levels of the local structure.

AB Machine learning algorithms have wide range of applications in bioinformatics and computational biology such as prediction of protein secondary structures, solvent accessibility, binding site residues in protein complexes, protein folding rates, stability of mutant proteins, and discrimination of proteins based on their structure and function. In this work, we focus on two aspects of predictions: (i) protein folding rates and (ii) stability of proteins upon mutations. We briefly introduce the concepts of protein folding rates and stability along with available databases, features for prediction methods and measures for prediction performance. Subsequently, the development of structure based parameters and their relationship with protein folding rates will be outlined. The structure based parameters are helpful to understand the physical basis for protein folding and stability. Further, basic principles of major machine learning techniques will be mentioned and their applications for predicting protein folding rates and stability of mutant proteins will be illustrated. The machine learning techniques could achieve the highest accuracy of predicting protein folding rates and stability. In essence, statistical methods and machine learning algorithms are complimenting each other for understanding and predicting protein folding rates and the stability of protein mutants. The available online resources on protein folding rates and stability will be listed.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as an important tool to identify intermediate biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its ability to measure regional changes in the brain that are thought to reflect disease severity and progression. In this paper, we set out a novel pipeline that uses volumetric MRI data collected from different subjects as input and classifies them into one of three classes: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN). Our pipeline consists of three stages - (1) a segmentation layer where brain MRI data is divided into clinically relevant regions; (2) a classification layer that uses relational learning algorithms to make pairwise predictions between the three classes; and (3) a combination layer that combines the results of the different classes to obtain the final classification. One of the key features of our proposed approach is that it allows for domain expert's knowledge to guide the learning in all the layers. We evaluate our pipeline on 397 patients acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate that it obtains state-of-the-art performance with minimal feature engineering.

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS

DE Biomedical Image Processing; Mycobacterium tuberculosis Detection;

AB The use of image processing techniques and artificial intelligence has emerged as the most popular technique for detection of tuberculosis (TB) bacilli. Numerous computer-aided techniques for automated TB bacilli detection in sputum smears have been proposed over the past few years to improve the accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the detection. However, little attention has focused on the detection of TB bacilli in tissue sections. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach for detecting the TB bacilli in tissue sections using image processing and neural networks. Images are obtained by scanning the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained tissue slides under a light microscope equipped with a digital camera. Then, image segmentation using thresholding and clustering techniques is applied to remove the tissue and background pixels. After segmentation, a set of six morphological features; area, perimeter, shape factor, minimum and maximum distance of a pixel in the boundary from the centroid, and eccentricity, are calculated for each region to describe shape properties. Finally, a single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) is used to classify the regions into three types; TB, overlapped TB and non-TB using the morphological features. Three recent algorithms for training SLFN called extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) and the improved extreme learning machine are evaluated for the classification. Results show that SLFN trained using the improved ELM substantially outperforms the ELM and OS-ELM. Promising result with 88.37% of testing accuracy has been achieved for the method. Also, the SLFN with the improved ELM was found to require less number of hidden nodes during the training phase, resulting in faster response in the testing phase.

AB Considering the nonlinear and time-variable characteristics of the injection cylinder system of hydraulic injection molding machine (HIMM), a self-learning control method based on fuzzy neural network is proposed in this paper. A self-learning controller was designed based on the combination of PID controller, fuzzy neural network controller, and learning mechanism. It was applied to the position control of injection cylinder. The experimental results show that the controller has the property of higher position tracking accuracy under the high speed and variable track movement of injection cylinder, compared with PID controller. The conclusion of this research can provide the beneficial reference for designing high speed and high precision HIMM.

AB Due to the strong competition that exists today, most retailers are in a continuous effort for increasing profits and reducing their cost. An accurate sales forecasting system is an efficient way to achieve the aforementioned goals and lead to improve the customers' satisfaction, reduce destruction of products, increase sales revenue and make production plan efficiently. In this study, the Gray extreme learning machine (GELM) integrates Gray relation analysis and extreme learning machine with Taguchi method to support purchasing decisions. GRA can sieve out the more influential factors from raw data and transforms them as the input data in a novel neural network such as ELM. The proposed system evaluated the real sales data in the retail industry. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system outperform several sales forecasting methods which are based on back-propagation neural networks such as BPN and MFLN models.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB From colour images acquired with a hand held digital camera, an innovative tool for assessing chronic wounds has been developed. It combines both types of assessment, colour analysis and dimensional measurement of injured tissues in a user-friendly system. Colour and texture descriptors have been extracted and selected from a sample database of wound tissues, before the learning stage of a support vector machine classifier with perceptron kernel on four categories of tissues. Relying on a triangulated 3D model captured using uncalibrated vision techniques applied on a stereoscopic image pair, a fusion algorithm elaborates new tissue labels on each model triangle from each view. The results of 2D classification are merged and directly mapped on the mesh surface of the 3D wound model. The result is a significative improvement in the robustness of the classification. Real tissue areas can be computed by retro projection of identified regions on the 3D model.

AB Our paper emphasizes the relevance of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in Bioinformatics applications by addressing the problem of predicting the disulfide connectivity from protein sequences. We test different activation functions of the hidden neurons and we show that for the task at hand the Radial Basis Functions are the best performing. We also show that the ELM approach performs better than the Back Propagation learning algorithm both in terms of generalization accuracy and running time. Moreover, we find that for the problem of the prediction of the disulfide connectivity it is possible to increase the predicting performance by initializing the Radial Basis Function kernels with a k-mean clustering algorithm.
   Finally, the ELM procedure is not only very fast but the final predicting networks can achieve an accuracy of 0.51 and 0.45, per-bonds and per-pattern, respectively. Our ELM results are in line with the state of the art predictors addressing the same problem.

ID MULTIPLE TASKS
AB Multitask learning is a learning paradigm which seeks to improve the generalization performance of a task with the help of other tasks. Learning multiple related tasks simultaneously has been empirically as well as theoretically shown to improve performance relative to learning each task independently. In this paper, we propose a new classification method named multitask twin support vector machines based on the regularization principle and twin support vector machines. Our new approach is that we put twin support vector machines to multitask learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method dramatically improves the performance relative to learning each task independently.

DE stochastic gradient descent; online learning; efficiency
AB During the last decade, the data sizes have grown faster than the speed of processors. In this context, the capabilities of statistical machine learning methods is limited by the computing time rather than the sample size. A more precise analysis uncovers qualitatively different tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-scale learning problems. The large-scale case involves the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithm in non-trivial ways. Unlikely optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent show amazing performance for large-scale problems. In particular, second order stochastic gradient and averaged stochastic gradient are asymptotically efficient after a single pass on the training set.

In this paper, a novel neural network technique called the ensemble of extreme learning machine (E-ELM) is proposed to investigate the interactions of different inducing factors affecting the evolution of landslide. Trend component displacement and periodic component displacement are forecasted respectively, then total predictive displacement is obtained by adding the calculated predictive displacement value of each sub. A case study of Baishuihe landslide in the Three Gorges reservoir area is presented to illustrate the capability and merit of our model.

The setup time is proportional to the length of the already processed jobs. That is, the setup time of each job is past-sequence-dependent. The objectives are to minimize the total absolute deviation of job completion times and the total load on all machines, respectively. We show that the proposed problem is polynomially solvable. We also discuss two special cases of the problem and show that they can be optimally solved by lower order algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To ensure plan quality for adaptive IMRT of the prostate, we developed a quantitative evaluation tool using a machine learning approach. This tool generates dose volume histograms (DVHs) of organs-at-risk (OARs) based on prior plans as a reference, to be compared with the adaptive plan derived from fluence map deformation.
   Methods: Under the same configuration using seven-field 15 MV photon beams, DVHs of OARs (bladder and rectum) were estimated based on anatomical information of the patient and a model learned from a database of high quality prior plans. In this study, the anatomical information was characterized by the organ volumes and distance-to-target histogram (DTH). The database consists of 198 high quality prostate plans and was validated with 14 cases outside the training pool. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to DVHs and DTHs to quantify their salient features. Then, support vector regression (SVR) was implemented to establish the correlation between the features of the DVH and the anatomical information.
   Results: DVH/DTH curves could be characterized sufficiently just using only two or three truncated principal components, thus, patient anatomical information was quantified with reduced numbers of variables.

AB This paper presents a feature-based image registration framework which exploits a novel machine learning (ML)-based interest point detection (IPD) algorithm for feature selection and correspondence detection. We use a feed-forward neural network (NN) with back-propagation as our base ML detector. Literature on ML-based IPD is scarce and to our best knowledge no previous research has addressed feature selection strategy for IPD purpose with cross-validation (CV) detectability measure. Our target application is the registration of clinical abdominal CT scans with abnormal anatomies. We evaluated the correspondence detection performance of the proposed ML-based detector against two well-known IPD algorithms: SIFT and SURF. The proposed method is capable of performing affine rigid registrations of 2D and 3D CT images, demonstrating more than two times better accuracy in correspondence detection than SIFT and SURF. The registration accuracy has been validated manually using identified landmark points. Our experimental results shows an improvement in 3D image registration quality of 18.92% compared with affine transformation image registration method from standard ITK affine registration toolkit.

AB Energy efficiency at the software level has gained much attention in the past decade. This paper presents a performance-aware frequency assignment algorithm for reducing processor energy consumption using Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Existing energy-saving techniques often rely on simplified predictions or domain knowledge to extract energy savings for specialized software (such as multimedia or mobile applications) or hardware (such as NPU or sensor nodes). We present an innovative framework, known as EClass, for general-purpose DVFS processors by recognizing short and repetitive utilization patterns efficiently using machine learning. Our algorithm is lightweight and can save up to 52.9% of the energy consumption compared with the classical PAST algorithm. It achieves an average savings of 9.1% when compared with an existing online learning algorithm that also utilizes the statistics from the current execution only. We have simulated the algorithms on a cycle-accurate power simulator. Experimental results show that EClass can effectively save energy for real life applications that exhibit mixed CPU utilization patterns during executions. Our research challenges an assumption among previous work in the research community that a simple and efficient heuristic should be used to adjust the processor frequency online. Our empirical result shows that the use of an advanced algorithm such as machine learning can not only compensate for the energy needed to run such an algorithm, but also outperforms prior techniques based on the above assumption.

AB The aim of the study was to examine the predictability of the competitive performance of Slovene tennis players by using the most promising morphological measures and motor tests selected by automatic computer methods and by experienced tennis coaches by means of machine learning methods. The analysis included altogether 1,002 male and female tennis players who had undergone regular testing by the National Tennis Association and were positioned on the ranking list of the Slovene Tennis Association between the years 1993 and 2008. Selections of the most promising variables by means of the two automatic methods yielded similar results, whereas the selection performed on the basis of estimates made by coaches differed considerably. With regard to the analysis by means of classification methods, an accurate predictability of competitive performance for the age category younger than 16 years was observed, while the results of predictions for the age category older than 16 were poor. Among the regression methods, as opposed to the linear regression, which has yielded satisfactory results, regression trees served no useful purpose in practice. Automatic methods for identifying the most promising variables proved to be more successful than those of the coaches, which was most clearly noticeable with regard to the female tennis players and when linear regression was used.

AB In most studies, the learning effect model applied in a scheduling problem assumes that the actual processing time of a job is a function of its scheduled position or the sum of the normal processing times of the jobs already scheduled. In this article, we introduce a learning effect model and a past-sequence-dependent (psd) setup time into a single machine group scheduling problem. The actual processing time of a job in each group is a function of the sum of the normal processing times of the jobs already scheduled and the position of the corresponding job group in the sequence. It shows that the addressed problem remains polynomially solvable for the objectives: minimisation of the makespan and the total completion time. It also shows that the smallest processing time rule provides the optimal jobs sequence in each group and the optimal group sequence for the addressed problem, respectively.

AB It is important to optimize aggregation schemes for heterogeneous wireless networks for maximizing communication throughput utilizing any available radio access networks. In the heterogeneous networks, differences of the quality of service (QoS), such as throughput, delay and packet loss rate, of the networks makes difficult to maximize the aggregation throughput. In this paper, we firstly analyze influences of such differences in QoS to the aggregation throughput, and show that it is possible to improve the throughput by adjusting the parameters of an aggregation system. Since manual parameter optimization is difficult and takes much time, we propose an autonomous parameter tuning scheme using a machine learning algorithm for the heterogeneous wireless network aggregation. We implement the proposed scheme on a heterogeneous cognitive radio network system. The results on our experimental network with network emulators show that the proposed scheme can improve the aggregation throughput better than the conventional schemes. We also evaluate the performance using public wireless network services, such as HSDPA, WiMAX and W-CDMA, and verify that the proposed scheme can improve the aggregation throughput by iterating the learning cycle even for the public wireless networks. Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves twice better aggregation throughput than the conventional schemes.

   Divergence; Gibbs Sampling
AB Learning algorithms relying on Gibbs sampling based stochastic approximations of the log-likelihood gradient have become a common way to train Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We study three of these methods, Contrastive Divergence (CD) and its refined variants Persistent CD (PCD) and Fast PCD (FPCD). As the approximations are biased, the maximum of the log-likelihood is not necessarily obtained. Recently, it has been shown that CD, PCD, and FPCD can even lead to a steady decrease of the log-likelihood during learning. Taking artificial data sets from the literature we study these divergence effects in more detail. Our results indicate that the log-likelihood seems to diverge especially if the target distribution is difficult to learn for the RBM. The decrease of the likelihood can not be detected by an increase of the reconstruction error, which has been proposed as a stopping criterion for CD learning. Weight-decay with a carefully chosen weight-decay-parameter can prevent divergence.

DE QoE; QoS; Machine Learning; Data classification models
AB The appearance of new emerging multimedia services have created new challenges for cloud service providers, which have to react quickly to end-users experience and offer a better Quality of Service (QoS). Cloud service providers should use such an intelligent system that can classify, analyze, and adapt to the collected information in an efficient way to satisfy end-users' experience. This paper investigates how different factors contributing the Quality of Experience (QoE), in the context of video streaming delivery over cloud networks. Important parameters which influence the QoE are: network parameters, characteristics of videos, terminal characteristics and types of users' profiles. We describe different methods that are often used to collect QoE datasets in the form of a Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Machine Learning (ML) methods are then used to classify a preliminary QoE dataset collected using these methods. We evaluate six classifiers and determine the most suitable one for the task of QoS/QoE correlation.

AB An analog VLSI implementation of on-line learning Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been developed for the classification of high-dimensional pattern vectors. A fully-parallel self-learning circuitry employing analog high-dimensional Gaussian-generation circuits was used as an SVM processor. This SVM processor achieves a high learning speed (one clock cycle at 10MHz) within compact chip area. Based on this SVM processor, an on-line learning system has been developed with the consideration of limited hardware resource. According to circuit simulation results, the image patterns from an actual database were all classified into correct classes by the proposed system. The ineffective samples are successfully identified in real-time and updated by on-line learning patterns.

   Extraction; SIM(X X*); Real time applications
AB In this paper, a novel digital image watermarking algorithm based on a fast neural network known as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for two grayscale images is proposed. The ELM algorithm is very fast and completes its training in milliseconds unlike its other counterparts such as BPN. The proposed watermarking algorithm trains the ELM by using low frequency coefficients of the grayscale host image in transform domain. The trained ELM produces a sequence of 1024 real numbers, normalized as per N(0, 1) as an output. This sequence is used as watermark to be embedded within the host image using Cox's formula to obtain the signed image. The visual quality of the signed images is evaluated by PSNR. High PSNR values indicate that the quality of signed images is quite good. The computed high value of SIM (X, X*) establishes that the extraction process is quite successful and overall the algorithm finds good practical applications, especially in situations that warrant meeting time constraints.

AB With the rapid development of the World Wide Web, information contained in the deep web is increasing dramatically. Since different query interfaces are heterogeneous and autonomous inherently, even in the same domain, it is a huge challenge to allow users efficiently and quickly to get their own satisfying information. Deep web query interfaces integration can solve this problem well. The interface schema matching is the foremost step in the steps of the deep web query interfaces integration. This paper takes 120 data sources as a training set and 40 data sources as a testing set. Combined with the idea of multi-strategy learning technology, a deep web interface schema matching method based on machine learning is proposed. The method transformed the schema matching problem into the machine learning classification, and achieved the schema matching automatically. In order to enhance the accuracy of the mappings, the concept of domain ontology is introduced in this paper. The experimental results show that the method has an average accuracy rate of 80%-90%.

AB Measurement of image quality is of fundamental importance to numerous image and video processing applications. Objective image quality assessment (IQA) is a two-stage process comprising of the following: (a) extraction of important information and discarding the redundant one, (b) pooling the detected features using appropriate weights. These two stages are not easy to tackle due to the complex nature of the human visual system (HVS). In this paper, we first investigate image features based on two-dimensional (20) mel-cepstrum for the purpose of IQA. It is shown that these features are effective since they can represent the structural information, which is crucial for IQA. Moreover, they are also beneficial in a reduced-reference scenario where only partial reference image information is used for quality assessment. We address the second issue by exploiting machine learning. In our opinion, the well established methodology of machine learning/pattern recognition has not been adequately used for IQA so far; we believe that it will be an effective tool for feature pooling since the required weights/parameters can be determined in a more convincing way via training with the ground truth obtained according to subjective scores. This helps to overcome the limitations of the existing pooling methods, which tend to be over simplistic and lack theoretical justification. Therefore, we propose a new metric by formulating IQA as a pattern recognition problem. Extensive experiments conducted using six publicly available image databases (totally 3211 images with diverse distortions) and one video database (with 78 video sequences) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed metric, in comparison with seven relevant existing metrics.

AB This study develops a model that attempts to mine advanced fee fraud activities through internet based emails correspondence for the purpose of forensic investigation. We extract various email document stylometrics, header and textural body content features that are used with support vector machine and Logistics regression machine learning algorithms to classify email documents into binary categories. Automatic word clustering algorithm is applied to partition a set of distinct words into clusters of semantically similar words to achieve space dimension reduction and classification efficiency. The classification accuracies of support vector machine and Logistics regression are compared. The results of this comparison show that the mean accuracy for support vector machine (M=95.20, SD=2.85) is not significantly different from the mean accuracy for Logistics regression (M=93.70, SD=2.51) using two sample t test for equal variance. Conclusively, support vector machine and Logistics regression are useful machine learning algorithms for identifying advanced fee fraud activities on the internet.

DE Trust management; Machine Learning; Digital credentials; Fading Memories
AB Many mission critical networks including MANETs for military communications and disaster relief communications rely on node cooperation. If malicious nodes gain access to such networks they can easily launch attacks, such as spreading viruses or spam, or attacking known vulnerabilities. One way to defend against malicious nodes is to use Reputation Systems (RS) that try to predict future behavior of nodes by observing their past behavior. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) based RS that defends against many patterns of attacks. We specifically consider the proposed RS in the context of MANETs. After introducing a basic RS, we propose further enhancements to it to improve its performance and to deal with some of the more challenging aspects of MANETs. For instance, we consider digital signature based mechanisms that do not require trusted third parties, or servers that are always online. Another enhancement uses an algorithm called Fading Memories that allows us to look back at longer histories using fewer features. Finally, we introduce a new technique, called Dynamic Thresholds, to improve accuracies even further. We compare the performance of our RS with another RS found in the literature, called TrustGuard, and perform detailed evaluations against a variety of attacks. The results show that our RS significantly outperforms TrustGuard, even when the proportion of malicious nodes in the network is high. We also show that our scheme has very low bandwidth and computation overhead. In contrast to existing RSs designed to detect specific attacks, ML based RSs can be retrained to detect new attack patterns as well. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is convenient and effective to solve nonlinear problems with a model that has a linear-in-the-parameters (LITP) structure. However, the nonlinear parameters (e.g. the width of Gaussian function) of each model term needs to be pre-determined either from expert experience or through exhaustive search. An alternative approach is to optimize them by a gradient-based technique (e.g. Newton's method). Unfortunately, all of these methods still need a lot of computations. Recently, the extreme learning machine (ELM) has shown its advantages in terms of fast learning from data, but the sparsity of the constructed model cannot be guaranteed. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for automatic construction of a nonlinear system model based on the extreme learning machine. This is achieved by effectively integrating the ELM and leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation with our two-stage stepwise construction procedure [1]. The main objective is to improve the compactness and generalization capability of the model constructed by the ELM method. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm only involves about half of the computation of orthogonal least squares (OLS) based method. Simulation examples are included to confirm the efficacy and superiority of the proposed technique. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID REGRESSION SPLINES MARS
AB A recently developed machine learning technique, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), is introduced in this study to predict vehicles' angle crashes. MARS has a promising prediction power, and does not suffer from interpretation complexity. Negative Binomial (NB) and MARS models were fitted and compared using extensive data collected on unsignalized intersections in Florida. Two models were estimated for angle crash frequency at 3- and 4-legged unsignalized intersections. Treating crash frequency as a continuous response variable for fitting a MARS model was also examined by considering the natural logarithm of the crash frequency. Finally, combining MARS with another machine learning technique (random forest) was explored and discussed. The fitted NB angle crash models showed several significant factors that contribute to angle crash occurrence at unsignalized intersections such as, traffic volume on the major road, the upstream distance to the nearest signalized intersection, the distance between successive unsignalized intersections, median type on the major approach, percentage of trucks on the major approach, size of the intersection and the geographic location within the state. Based on the mean square prediction error (MSPE) assessment criterion, MARS outperformed the corresponding NB models. Also, using MARS for predicting continuous response variables yielded more favorable results than predicting discrete response variables. The generated MARS models showed the most promising results after screening the covariates using random forest. Based on the results of this study. MARS is recommended as an efficient technique for predicting crashes at unsignalized intersections (angle crashes in this study). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High-throughput genotyping and sequencing techniques are rapidly and inexpensively providing large amounts of human genetic variation data. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an important source of human genome variability and have been implicated in several human diseases, including cancer. Amino acid mutations resulting from non-synonymous SNPs in coding regions may generate protein functional changes that affect cell proliferation. In this study, we developed a machine learning approach to predict cancer-causing missense variants. We present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a set of 3163 cancer-causing variants and an equal number of neutral polymorphisms. The method achieve 93% overall accuracy, a correlation coefficient of 0.86, and area under ROC curve of 0.98. When compared with other previously developed algorithms such as SIFT and CHASM our method results in higher prediction accuracy and correlation coefficient in identifying cancer-causing variants.

AB The voice activity detectors (VADs) based on statistical models have shown impressive performances especially when fairly precise statistical models arc employed. Moreover, the accuracy of the VAD utilizing statistical models can be significantly improved when machine-learning techniques are adopted to provide prior knowledge for speech characteristics. In the first part of this paper, we introduce a more accurate and flexible statistical model, the generalized gamma distribution (G Gamma D) as a new model in the VAD based on the likelihood ratio test. In practice, parameter estimation algorithm based on maximum likelihood principle is also presented. Experimental results show that the VAD algorithm implemented based on G Gamma D outperform those adopting the conventional Laplacian and Gamma distributions. In the second part of this paper, we introduce machine learning techniques such as a minimum classification error (MCE) and support vector machine (SVM) to exploit automatically prior knowledge obtained from the speech database, which can enhance the performance of the VAD. Firstly, we present a discriminative weight training method based on the MCE criterion. In this approach, the VAD decision rule becomes the geometric mean of optimally weighted likelihood ratios. Secondly, the SVM-based approach is introduced to assist the VAD based on statistical models. In this algorithm, the SVM efficiently classifies the input signal into two classes which arc voice active and voice inactive regions with nonlinear boundary. Experimental results show that these training-based approaches can effectively enhance the performance of the VAD. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A new machine learning SoC (MLSoC) for multimedia content analysis is implemented with 16-mm(2) area in 90-nm CMOS technology. Different from traditional VLSI architectures, it focuses on the coacceleration of computer vision and machine learning algorithms, and two stream processors with massively parallel processing elements are integrated to achieve tera-scale performance. In the dual stream processor (DSP) architecture, the data are transferred between processors and the high-bandwidth dual memory (HBDM) through the local media bus without consuming the AMBA AHB bandwidth. The image stream processor (ISP) of the MLSoC can handle common window-based operations for image processing, and the feature stream processor (FSP) can deal with machine learning algorithms with different dimensions. The power efficiency of the proposed MLSoC is 1.7 TOPS/W, and the area efficiency is 81.3 GOPS/mm(2).

AB Alternative splicing is a main component of protein diversity, and aberrant splicing is known to be one of the main causes of genetic disorders such as cancer. Many statistical and computational approaches have identified several major factors that determine the splicing event, such as exon/intron length, splice site strength, and density of splicing enhancers or silencers. These factors may be correlated with one another and thus result in a specific type of splicing, but there has not been a systematic approach to extracting comprehensible association patterns. Here, we attempted to understand the decision making process of the learning machine on intron retention event. We adopted a hybrid learning machine approach using a random forest and association rule mining algorithm to determine the governing factors of intron retention events and their combined effect on decision-making processes. By quantifying all candidate features into five category values, we enhanced the understandability of generated rules. The interesting features found by the random forest algorithm are that only the adenine- and thymine-based triplets such as ATA, TTA, and ATT, but not the known intronic splicing enhancer GGG triplet is shown the significant features. The rules generated by the association rule mining algorithm also show that constitutive introns are generally characterized by high adenine- and thymine-based triplet frequency (level 3 and above), 3' and 5' splice site scores, exonic splicing silencer scores, and intron length, whereas retained introns are characterized by low-level counterpart scores.

AB Reverse vaccinology aims to accelerate subunit vaccine design by rapidly predicting which proteins in a pathogenic bacterial proteome are putative protective antigens. Support vector machine classification is a machine learning approach that has been applied to solve numerous classification problems in biological sciences but has not previously been incorporated into a reverse vaccinology approach. A training data set of 136 bacterial protective antigens paired with 136 non-antigens was constructed and bioinformatic tools were used to annotate this data for predicted protein features, many of which are associated with antigenicity (i.e. extracellular localization, signal peptides and B-cell epitopes). Annotation was used to train support vector machine classifiers that exhibited a maximum accuracy of 92% for discriminating protective antigens from non-antigens as assessed by a leave-tenth-out cross-validation approach. These accuracies were superior to those achieved when annotating training data with auto and cross covariance transformations of z-descriptors for hydrophobicity, molecular size and polarity, or when classification was performed using regression methods. To further validate support vector machine classifiers, they were used to rank all the proteins in six bacterial proteomes for their antigenicity. Protective antigens from the training data were significantly recalled (enriched) in the top 75 ranked proteins for all six proteomes as assessed by a Fisher's exact test (p < 0.05). This paper describes a superior workflow for performing reverse vaccinology studies and provides a benchmark training data set that can be used to evaluate future methodological improvements.

AB Machine learning methods are successfully applied in many branches of Computer Science. One of these branches is image analysis, and being more specific - Automatic Image Annotation. Automatic Image Annotation was found an important research domain several years ago. It grew from such research domains as image recognition and cross-lingual machine translation. Increase of computational, data storage and data transfer abilities of todays' computers has been one of key factors, making Automatic Image Annotation possible. Automatic Image Annotation methods, which have appeared during last several years, make a large use of many machine learning approaches. Clustering and classification methods are most frequently applied to annotate images. The chapter consists of three main parts. In the first, some general information concerning annotation methods is presented. In the second part, two original annotation methods are described. The last part presents experimental studies of the proposed methods.

AB Because the quality of fingerprints can be degraded by diverse factors, recognizing the quality of fingerprints in advance can be beneficial for improving the performance of fingerprint authentication systems. This paper proposes an effective fingerprint quality analysis approach based on the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM). The proposed method is based not only on basic fingerprint properties, but also on the physical properties of the various sensors. Instead of splitting a fingerprint image into traditional small blocks, direction-based segmentation using the Gabor filter is used. From the segmented image, a feature set which consists of four selected independent local or global features: orientation certainty, local orientation quality, consistency, and ridge distance, is extracted. The selected feature set is robust against various factors responsible for quality degradation and can satisfy the requirements of different types of capture sensors. With the contribution of the OS-ELM classifier, the extracted feature set is used to determine whether or not a fingerprint image should be accepted as an input to the recognition system. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better in terms of accuracy and time consumed than BPNN-based and SVM-based methods. An obvious improvement to the fingerprint recognition system is achieved by adding a quality analysis system. Other comparisons to traditional methods also show that the proposed method outperforms others.

AB Face image retrieval (FIR) is useful to many domain applications, such as helping police to catch criminals or managing householders. However, little research has been done that uses individual face features for image comparison and retrieval. This paper aims to develop a machine learning approach for face image retrieval based on the local face features of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Neural networks are used to localise facial features, and to implement a learning pseudo metric (LPM) to filter out irrelevant images for retrieval efficiently based on semantic information. Our FIR system performs below average given traditional performance measures, but inspecting actual retrieved images it shows strong promise. It is observed that the LPM semantic filtering method was found to reduce the database size by up to 50% without a significant reduction in retrieval performance.

AB Modernization of today's irrigation systems attempts to improve system efficiency and management effectiveness of every component of the system (reservoirs, canals, and gates) using automation technologies, along with hydraulic simulation models. The canal flow control scheme resulting from the coupling of the system automation and the simulation models has proven to be an excellent irrigation water management instrument around the world. Nevertheless, the harsh environment of irrigation systems can induce uncertainties or errors in the components of canal flow control that can worsen over time, misleading or confusing both human and computer controllers. These errors can be attributed to parameter measurement and conceptual sources, with the complexity of locating their individual origin. In this paper, a framework is presented to minimize the collective or aggregate error within an irrigation canal flow control scheme that uses a learning machine algorithm (multilayer perceptron and relevance vector machine) embedded in a hydraulic simulation model fed by a canal automation system. This framework is evaluated using actual data from an irrigation conveyance canal located at the Lower Sevier River Basin in Utah. The results obtained prove the adequacy of the proposed framework in minimizing the aggregate error, which affects the simulation results of the automation system (up to 91% in bias and 83% in maximum absolute error) when compared with the original values obtained in the verification period. The temporal correlation of the aggregate error was also significantly reduced, thus resulting in reduced local biases and structures in the model prediction error.

ID COMMUNICATION
AB We consider an automated agent that needs to coordinate with a human partner when communication between them is not possible or is undesirable (tacit coordination games). Specifically, we examine situations where an agent and human attempt to coordinate their choices among several alternatives with equivalent utilities. We use machine learning algorithms to help the agent predict human choices in these tacit coordination domains. Experiments have shown that humans are often able to coordinate with one another in communication-free games, by using focal points, "prominent" solutions to coordination problems. We integrate focal point rules into the machine learning process, by transforming raw domain data into a new hypothesis space. We present extensive empirical results from three different tacit coordination domains. The Focal Point Learning approach results in classifiers with a 40-80% higher correct classification rate, and shorter training time, than when using regular classifiers, and a 35% higher correct classification rate than classical focal point techniques without learning. In addition, the integration of focal points into learning algorithms results in agents that are more robust to changes in the environment. We also present several results describing various biases that might arise in Focal Point based coordination.

AB Transfer learning, serving as one of the most popular theory in machine learning, has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this paper, we propose a new learning strategy called part-based transfer learning (pbTL), which is a process of parameter transfer. Dissimilar to many traditional works, we consider how to transfer the information from one task to another in the form of parts. We regard all the complex tasks as a collection of constituent parts and every task can be divided into several parts respectively. It means transfer learning between two complex tasks can be accomplished by sub-transfer learning tasks between their parts. Through developing it in this hierarchical fasion, we can reach a better outcome. Experiments on synthetic data with support vector machines (SVMs) validate the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

AB Programs co-running on cores share resources on multi-core processor systems. It is now well known that interference between the programs arising from the sharing may result in severe performance degradations. It is the objective of recent research in system scheduling to be aware of shared resource requirements of the running programs (threads). To this end AKULA is a toolset recently developed that provides a platform for experiments and developing thread scheduling algorithms on multi-core processors. In AKULA a bootstrapping module works on the basis of previously collected performance data of programs to simulate program execution on multi-cores. In this paper we describe a different approach where that augments such a bootstrapping module with a model built using machine learning techniques. The proposed model will extend the bootstrapping module's ability to predict degradation in performance due to sharing where previous performance data is not available for pairing /co-scheduling of applications. Also the proposed approach allows greater scalability for variable number of processor cores sharing the resources.

AB Graphical avatars have gained popularity in many application domains such as three-dimensional (3D) animation movies and animated simulations for product design. However, the methods to edit avatars' behaviors in the 3D graphical environment remained to be a challenging research topic. Since the hand-crafted methods are time-consuming and inefficient, the automatic actions of the avatars are required. To achieve the autonomous behaviors of the avatars, artificial intelligence should be used in this research area. In this paper, we present a novel approach to construct a system of automatic avatars in the 3D graphical environments based on the machine learning techniques. Specific framework is created for controlling the behaviors of avatars, such as classifying the difference among the environments and using hierarchical structure to describe these actions. Because of the requirement of simulating the interactions between avatars and environments after the classification of the environment, Reinforcement Learning is used to compute the policy to control the avatar intelligently in the 3D environment for the solution of the problem of different situations. Thus, our approach has solved problems such as where the levels of the missions will be defined and how the learning algorithm will be used to control the avatars. In this paper, our method to achieve these goals will be presented. The main contributions of this paper are presenting a hierarchical structure to control avatars automatically, developing a method for avatars to recognize environment and presenting an approach for making the policy of avatars' actions intelligently.

AB Wavelet parameters (e. g., wavelet type, level of decomposition) affect the performance of the wavelet denoising algorithm in hyperspectral applications. Current studies select the best wavelet parameters for a single spectral curve by comparing similarity criteria such as spectral angle (SA). However, the method to find the best parameters for a spectral library that contains multiple spectra has not been studied. In this paper, a criterion named normalized spectral angle (NSA) is proposed. By comparing NSA, the best combination of parameters for a spectral library can be selected. Moreover, a fast algorithm based on threshold constraint and machine learning is developed to reduce the time of a full search. After several iterations of learning, the combination of parameters that constantly surpasses a threshold is selected. The experiments proved that by using the NSA criterion, the SA values decreased significantly, and the fast algorithm could save 80% time consumption, while the denoising performance was not obviously impaired.

ID SOLUTION PATH; REGRESSION; IMPLEMENTATION; ALGORITHM
AB We propose a multiple incremental decremental algorithm of support vector machines (SVM). In online learning, we need to update the trained model when some new observations arrive and/or some observations become obsolete. If we want to add or remove single data point, conventional single incremental decremental algorithm can be used to update the model efficiently. However, to add and/or remove multiple data points, the computational cost of current update algorithm becomes inhibitive because we need to repeatedly apply it for each data point. In this paper, we develop an extension of incremental decremental algorithm which efficiently works for simultaneous update of multiple data points. Some analyses and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can substantially reduce the computational cost. Our approach is especially useful for online SVM learning in which we need to remove old data points and add new data points in a short amount of time.

AB Model trees are a particular case of decision trees employed to solve regression problems. They have the advantage of presenting an interpretable output, helping the end-user to get more confidence in the prediction and providing the basis for the end-user to have new insight about the data, confirming or rejecting hypotheses previously formed. Moreover, model trees present an acceptable level of predictive performance in comparison to most techniques used for solving regression problems. Since generating the optimal model tree is an NP-Complete problem, traditional model tree induction algorithms make use of a greedy top-down divide-and-conquer strategy, which may not converge to the global optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on the use of the evolutionary algorithms paradigm as an alternate heuristic to generate model trees in order to improve the convergence to globally near-optimal solutions. We call our new approach evolutionary model tree induction (E-Motion). We test its predictive performance using public UCI data sets, and we compare the results to traditional greedy regression/model trees induction algorithms, as well as to other evolutionary approaches. Results show that our method presents a good trade-off between predictive performance and model comprehensibility, which may be crucial in many machine learning applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB We know that fusion rule in spatial domainbased multiple exposure fusion methods, the sum weighted average is usually used in which same weight value is assigned for each source image, regardless of the details contained in it. Furthermore, using only single feature to design the fusion rule is also commonly adopted. However, utilizing single feature to measure the quality of one image is not comprehensive. As a result, the detail losing and contrast reduction are caused by these rules. In the paper, In order to use multiple features extracted from one image simultaneously to obtain an adaptive weight value for the image, we propose an exposure fusion method called (ELM_EF). It is based on a regression method called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Firstly, we construct input vector for ELM using contrast, saturation and exposedness features from the chosen representative blocks. The label of input is obtained by using a Gaussian function with exposure setting of the image served as a parameter. Thus, training model can be got. Secondly, the statistic values of these features about each tested image are calculated, it is used for deciding the weight value of corresponding image with the training model. Experiments show that the proposed method can preserve more details and contrast than the sum weighted average method. Moreover, it can give comparative or even better results compared to other typical exposure fusion methods.

We use machine learning as a tool to study and analyze the relationship between the factors and the overall perceived video quality. It is shown that apart from their individual contributions, the interaction of the two factors also plays a role in determining the overall video quality.

DE Interactive traffic; Machine Learning (ML); sub-flows; traffic
   classification
AB Machine Learning (ML) for classifying IP traffic has relied on the analysis of statistics of full flows or their first few packets only. However, automated QoS management for interactive traffic flows requires quick and timely classification well before the flows finish. Also, interactive flows are often long-lived and should be continuously monitored during their lifetime. We propose to achieve this by using statistics derived from sub-flows-a small number of most recent packets taken at any point in a flow's lifetime. Then, the ML classifier must be trained on a set of sub-flows, and we investigate different sub-flow selection strategies. We also propose to augment training datasets so that classification accuracy is maintained even when a classifier mixes up client-to-server and server-to-client directions for applications exhibiting asymmetric traffic characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with the Naive Bayes and C4.5 Decision Tree ML algorithms, for the identification of first-person-shooter online game and VoIP traffic. Our results show that we can classify both applications with up to 99% Precision and 95% Recall within less than 1 s. Stable results are achieved regardless of where within a flow the classifier captures the packets and the traffic direction.

AB Alburnus alburnus alborella is a fish species native to northern Italy. It has suffered a very sharp decrease in population over the last 20 years due to human impact. Therefore, it was selected for reintroduction projects. In this research project, support vector machines (SVM) were tested as possible tools for building reliable models of presence/absence of the species. A system of 198 sites located along the rivers of Piedmont in North-Western Italy was investigated. At each site, 19 physical-chemical and environmental variables were measured. We verified that performances did not improve after feature selection but, instead, they slightly decreased (from Correctly Classified Instances [CCI] = 84.34 and Cohen's k [k] = 0.69 to CCI = 82.81 and k = 0.66). However, feature selection is crucial in identifying the relevant features for the presence/absence of the species. We then compared SVMs performances with decision trees (DTs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) built using the same dataset. SVMs outperformed DTs (CCI = 81.39 and k = 0.63) but not ANNs (CCI = 83.03 and k = 0.66), showing that SVMs and ANNs are the best performing models, proving that their application in freshwater management is more promising than traditional and other machine-learning techniques.

AB Objective Computers have become essential in the life of many people with disabilities. A common activity that can be computer assisted is text generation. People who cannot accurately control their extremities (due to cerebral palsy, etc.) may use computers as writing tools, and if they have problems to speak, they may use a computer to communicate. In both cases, the generation of text is a necessary activity that can be physically demanding and extremely slow. Word prediction methods are commonly used to assist in this task. The objective of our work is to improve the quality of a word prediction system for Brazilian Portuguese, in order to reduce the effort and time needed to write texts.
   Main content The selection of the predicted words is partly based on a two steps process. Firstly, the possible parts-of-speech (POS) of the next word are predicted from the POS of the previous words. Secondly, the list of predicted words is generated from these predicted POS and the information contained in the lexicons. In this paper we present prediction algorithms based on machine learning methods adapted to POS prediction (the first step of the process). Specifically, this work describes the use of artificial neural networks, support vector machines and regularized logistic models to predict word POS in Brazilian Portuguese, based on the POS of the 1, 2, 3 or 4 previous words. We also briefly describe a meta-learning strategy for algorithm selection and a fusion algorithm to combine them.
   Results These methods increase the word prediction quality, saving a maximum of 38.26% of the keystrokes needed to write the text (a relative improvement of 9.85% with respect to the unigram method), and correctly predicting 79.95% of the words in the experiments performed (with a maximum of 28.5% of hit rate).
   Conclusions Besides presenting evidences that such methods can be adapted to predict word POS, it is also shown that they are robust, consistent and easy to incorporate into a general word prediction system. In future works, the Portuguese prediction system will be included in PredWin, a freely available text editor and communicator already working for Spanish. The whole word prediction system will also be adapted, trained and evaluated in other languages, such as English, and included in PredWin in case good results were obtained.

AB The machine learning approach to fault diagnosis consists of a chain of activities such as data acquisition, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Each one is equally important in fault diagnosis. As machine learning is a soft science, there is a lot of scope for finding mathematical reasoning which otherwise researchers do it arbitrarily or heuristically. Minimum number of samples required to separate faulty conditions, with statistical stability is one such important factor. This paper provides a method for determination of minimum sample size using power analysis. A typical bearing fault diagnosis problem is taken as a case for illustration and the results are compared with that of entropy-based algorithm (J48) for determining minimum sample size. The results will serve as a guideline for researchers working in fault diagnosis area to choose appropriate sample size. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The availability of compact fast circuitry for the support of artificial neural systems is a long-standing and critical requirement for many important applications. This brief addresses the implementation of the powerful extreme learning machine (ELM) model on reconfigurable digital hardware (HW). The design strategy first provides a training procedure for ELMs, which effectively trades off prediction accuracy and network complexity. This, in turn, facilitates the optimization of HW resources. Finally, this brief describes and analyzes two implementation approaches: one involving field-programmable gate array devices and one embedding low-cost low-performance devices such as complex programmable logic devices. Experimental results show that, in both cases, the design approach yields efficient digital architectures with satisfactory performances and limited costs.

AB In this paper we consider the scheduling problem with a general exponential learning effect and past-sequence-dependent (p-s-d) setup times. By the general exponential learning effect, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by an exponent function of the total weighted normal processing time of the already processed jobs and its position in a sequence, where the weight is a position-dependent weight. The setup times are proportional to the length of the already processed jobs. We consider the following objective functions: the makespan, the total completion time, the sum of the delta >= 0th power of completion times, the total weighted completion time and the maximum lateness. We show that the makespan minimization problem, the total completion time minimization problem and the sum of the quadratic job completion times minimization problem can be solved by the smallest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule, respectively. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions.

AB With chemical libraries increasingly containing millions of compounds or more, there is a fast-growing need for computational methods that can rank or prioritize compounds for screening. Machine learning methods have shown considerable promise for this task; indeed, classification methods such as support vector machines (SVMs), together with their variants, have been used in virtual screening to distinguish active compounds from inactive ones, while regression methods such as partial least-squares (PLS) and support vector regression (SVR) have been used in quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analysis for predicting biological activities of compounds. Recently, a new class of machine learning methods namely, ranking methods, which are designed to directly optimize ranking performance have been developed for ranking tasks such as web search that arise in information retrieval (IR) and other applications. Here we report the application of these new ranking methods in machine learning to the task of ranking chemical structures. Our experiments show that the new ranking methods give better ranking performance than both classification based methods in virtual screening and regression methods in QSAR analysis. We also make some interesting connections between ranking performance measures used in cheminformatics and those used in IR studies.

AB Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been widely used as powerful information processing models and adopted in applications such as bankruptcy prediction, predicting costs, forecasting revenue, forecasting share prices and exchange rates, processing documents and many more. This paper uses Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm for Higher Order Neural Network (HONN) models and applies it in several significant business cases. HONNs are neural networks in which the net input to a computational neuron is a weighted sum of products of its inputs. ELM algorithms randomly choose hidden layer neurons and then only adjust the output weights which connect the hidden layer and the output layer. The experimental results demonstrate that HONN models with ELM algorithm offer significant advantages over standard HONN models as well as traditional ANN models, such as reduced network size, faster training, as well improved simulation and forecasting errors.

AB Adaptation of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in the heterogeneous and adversarial network environments is crucial. We design an adaptive IDS that has 10% higher accuracy than the best of four different baseline IDSs. Rather than creating a new 'super' IDS, we combine the outputs of the IDSs by using the online learning framework proposed by Bousquet and Warmuth [1]. The combination framework allows to dynamically determine the best IDSs performed in different segments of a dataset. Moreover, to increase the accuracy and reliability of the intrusion detection results, the fusion between outputs of the four IDSs is taken into account by a new expanded framework. We conduct the experiments on two different datasets for benchmarking Web Application Firewalls: the ECML-PKDD 2007 HTTP dataset and the CISIC HTTP 2010. Experimental results show the high adaptability of the proposed IDS.

AB Machine learning is used to approximate density functionals. For the model problem of the kinetic energy of noninteracting fermions in 1D, mean absolute errors below 1 kcal/mol on test densities similar to the training set are reached with fewer than 100 training densities. A predictor identifies if a test density is within the interpolation region. Via principal component analysis, a projected functional derivative finds highly accurate self-consistent densities. The challenges for application of our method to real electronic structure problems are discussed.

AB Scheduling with learning effects has received continuing attention in the recent days. However, it can be found that the actual processing time of a given job drops to zero precipitously as the job has a big processing time or the number of jobs increases. Moreover, most researchers paid more attention to single-machine settings, and the flowshop settings then are relatively unexplored. Motivated by these observations, we consider a two-machine total completion time flowshop problem in which the actual job processing time is a function depending on the jobs that have already been processed and a control parameter. In this paper, we develop a branch-and-bound and a genetic heuristic-based algorithm for the problem. In addition, the experimental results of all proposed algorithms are also provided.

TI Learning state machine-based string edit kernels
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
LA English
DT Article
DE String kernel; Marginalized kernel; Learned edit distance
ID DISTANCE
AB During the past few years, several works have been done to derive string kernels from probability distributions. For instance, the Fisher kernel uses a generative model M (e.g. a hidden Markov model) and compares two strings according to how they are generated by M. On the other hand, the marginalized kernels allow the computation of the joint similarity between two instances by summing conditional probabilities. In this paper, we adapt this approach to edit distance-based conditional distributions and we present a way to learn a new string edit kernel. We show that the practical computation of such a kernel between two strings x and x' built from an alphabet requires (i) to learn edit probabilities in the form of the parameters of a stochastic state machine and (ii) to calculate an infinite sum over Sigma* by resorting to the intersection of probabilistic automata as done for rational kernels. We show on a handwritten character recognition task that our new kernel outperforms not only the state of the art string kernels and string edit kernels but also the standard edit distance used by a neighborhood-based classifier.

AB In this paper we consider a direct application of advanced machine learning methods to standard model of time sequences data to avoid preprocessing. Besides classical machine learning methods, such as support vector machines, we used kernel learning to improve accuracy of learned knowledge. Kernel learning, especially multiple kernel learning (MKL), allows automated model creation to describe complex data and performs feature selection. The approach is tested using several publicly available machine learning software tools and time series datasets and its good generalization properties are demonstrated.

AB The objective of this paper is to reveal the effectiveness of wavelet based tissue texture analysis for microcalcification detection in digitized mammograms using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Microcalcifications are tiny deposits of calcium in the breast tissue which are potential indicators for early detection of breast cancer. The dense nature of the breast tissue and the poor contrast of the mammogram image prohibit the effectiveness in identifying microcalcifications. Hence, a new approach to discriminate the microcalcifications from the normal tissue is done using wavelet features and is compared with different feature vectors extracted using Gray Level Spatial Dependence Matrix (GLSDM) and Gabor filter based techniques. A total of 120 Region of Interests (ROIs) extracted from 55 mammogram images of mini-Mias database, including normal and microcalcification images are used in the current research. The network is trained with the above mentioned features and the results denote that ELM produces relatively better classification accuracy (94%) with a significant reduction in training time than the other artificial neural networks like Bayesnet classifier, Naivebayes classifier, and Support Vector Machine. ELM also avoids problems like local minima, improper learning rate, and over fitting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A typical characteristic of images of bone marrow cells taken during mitosis is poor quality. This renders the task of extraction of accurate band profile, representative of intensity distribution over each chromosome, more challenging. A robust method is hence required to tackle this problem. An algorithm was thus developed, which estimates a single-line medial axis, the basis for computation of band profile. Medial axis was generated by computing a final prediction, using primary and secondary predictions obtained by a nonparametric machine learning algorithm trained with data from chromosome's skeleton, and geometrical properties of medial axis, respectively. Experiments were performed using the LK(1) dataset. The algorithm was found capable of estimating a satisfactory single-line medial axis. Band profile obtained was found to be a good representation of intensity levels in different regions of chromosomes. Additionally, this algorithm is robust in terms of growing a very small seed region into desired medial axis and also handling highly irregular chromosomes.

AB In this paper a novel gene selection method based on personalized modeling is presented and is compared with classical machine learning techniques to identify diagnostic gene targets and to use them for a successful diagnosis of a medical problem - acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). An analysis using the integrated approach of new data with the existing models is evaluated. The aGVHD is the major complication after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in which functional immune cells of donor, recognize the recipient as "foreign" and mount an immunologic attack. Identifying a compact set of genes from gene expression data is a critical step in bioinformatics research. Personalized modeling is a recently introduced technique for constructing clinical decision support systems. In this work we have provided a comparative study using the proposed Personalized Modeling based Gene Selection method (PMGS) on the GvHD Macroarray dataset collected. This is the first study which utilises both computational and biological evidence for the involvement of a limited number of genes for the diagnosis of aGVHD and the use of a personalized modeling for the analysis of this disease. Directions for further studies are also outlined.

A machine learning algorithm enables adaptive recommendation of spots for the mobile users based on their real-time context such as preference, location, weather, time, etc. Our proposed guide system recommends context-aware information for any users by switching two kinds of recommendation algorithms according to the number of user's training data. By experiments using our implemented system in real environments, we confirm that our implemented system correctly works on the off-the-shelf mobile phones having a built-in GPS module and show that it recommends useful information for the mobile users according to their context.

In this algorithm, a presented composite chaos system and mutative scale chaos method are utilized first to search and optimize the parameters of ELM for improving the generalization performance. Then the optimized ELM is used to predict the multivariable chaotic time series of Rossler coupled system for single step and muti-step, and the scheme is compared with the congeneric method, which shows the validity and stronger ability against noise of the developed algorithm. Finally, the relation between prediction result and number of hidden neurons is discussed.

   Theory; Evolutionary Algorithm
AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an approach recently proposed in the literature for Neural Network (NN) training. It has been shown to be much faster than the traditional gradient-based learning algorithms, with many variants, extensions and applications also investigated in the last few years. Among them, the ELM paradigm has been applied to train Time-Variant Neural Networks (TV-NN), through which the training time can be greatly reduced w.r.t. common Back-Propagation (BP). However, this approach may require more hidden nodes and the right type of basis function (through which time-dependence is introduced in TV-NN weight parameters) to attain good generalization. In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning algorithm, which applies differential evolutionary (to determine related input weights) and group selection method (to determine the type of basis function). Experimental results show that the proposed method allows achieving more compact networks yet with better generalization performance at the cost of larger training time; moreover the algorithm behavior is anyway significantly more performing than the BP one.

AB Recently, evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been utilized for the design of accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule-based systems. This research area is often referred to as multiobjective genetic fuzzy systems (MoGFS), where EMO algorithms are used to search for non-dominated fuzzy rule-based systems with respect to their accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we examine the ability of EMO algorithms to efficiently search for Pareto optimal or near Pareto optimal fuzzy rule-based systems for classification problems. We use NSGA-II (elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm), its variants, and MOEA/D (multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition) in our multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning (MoFGBML) algorithm. Classification performance of obtained fuzzy rule-based systems by each EMO algorithm is evaluated for training data and test data under various settings of the available computation load and the granularity of fuzzy partitions. Experimental results in this paper suggest that reported classification performance of MoGFS in the literature can be further improved using more computation load, more efficient EMO algorithms, and/or more antecedent fuzzy sets from finer fuzzy partitions.

AB The focus of this work is to analyze parallel machine earliness/tardiness (ET) scheduling problem with simultaneous effects of learning and linear deterioration, sequence-dependent setups, and a common due-date for all jobs. By the effects of learning and linear deterioration, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by an increasing function of its starting time and a decreasing function of the position in the sequence. We develop a mixed integer programming formulation for the problem and show that the optimal sequence is V-shaped: all jobs scheduled before the shortest jobs and all jobs scheduled after the shortest job are in a non-increasing and non-decreasing order of processing times, respectively. The developed model allows sequence-dependent setups and sequence-dependent early/tardy penalties. The illustrative example with 11 jobs for 2 machines and 3 machines shows that the model can easily provide the optimal solution, which is V-shaped, for problem.

AB Unsupervised learning is a class of problems in machine learning which seeks to determine how the data are organized. Unsupervised learning encompasses many other techniques that seek to summarize and explain key features of the data. One form of unsupervised learning is blind source separation (BSS). BSS is a class of computational data analysis techniques for revealing hidden factors that underlie sets of measurements or signals. BSS assumes a statistical model whereby the observed multivariate data, typically given as a large database of samples, are assumed to be linear or nonlinear mixtures of some unknown latent variables. The mixing coefficients are also unknown. Sometimes more prior information about the sources is available or is induced into the model, such as the form of their probability densities, their spectral contents, etc. Then the term blind is often replaced by semiblind. This chapter reports the semi BSS machine learning applications on audio and bio signal processing.

AB There are two items that significantly enhance the generalisation ability (i.e. classification accuracy) of machine learning-based classifiers: feature selection (including parameter optimisation) and an ensemble of the classifiers. Accordingly, the objective in this study is to develop an ensemble of classifiers based on a genetic algorithm (GA) wrapper feature selection approach for real time scheduling (RTS). The proposed approach can better enhance the generalisation ability of the RTS knowledge base (i.e. classifier) in comparison with three classical machine learning-based classifier RTS systems, including the GA-based wrapper feature selection mechanism, in terms of the prediction accuracy of 10-fold cross validation as measured according to all the performance criteria. The proposed ensemble classifier RTS also provides better system performance than the three machine learning-based RTS systems, including the GA-based wrapper feature selection mechanism and heuristic dispatching rules, under all the performance criteria, over a long period in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) case study.

AB This paper presents results of an experiment in which we used machine learning (ML) techniques to classify sentences in Dutch legislation. These results are compared to the results of a pattern-based classifier. Overall, the ML classifier performs as accurate (>90%) as the pattern based one, but seems to generalize worse to new laws. Given these results, the pattern based approach is to be preferred since its reasons for classification are clear and can be used for further modelling of the content of the sentences.

These systems represent a significant breakthrough in humanity's decades-long endeavor to build computers that are "more like us''-fundamentally designed to map to and support human abilities and where the needs of people are central to the design process. This paper examines the human aspects of developing such new technology, with a focus on question-and-answer machine-learning systems. Considerations such as how human behavior should be addressed in the design and development of such systems are presented, followed by a series of potential application domains for the new technology.

AB Acupoint specificity, lying at the core of the Traditional Chinese Medicine, underlies the theoretical basis of acupuncture application. However, recent studies have reported that acupuncture stimulation at nonacupoint and acupoint can both evoke similar signal intensity decreases in multiple regions. And these regions were spatially overlapped. We used a machine learning based Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to elucidate the specific neural response pattern induced by acupuncture stimulation. Group analysis demonstrated that stimulation at two different acupoints (belong to the same nerve segment but different meridians) could elicit distinct neural response patterns. Our findings may provide evidence for acupoint specificity.

ID SUBJECT
AB In this paper, we study the single-machine scheduling problems with learning effect and setup time considerations. The setup times are proportional to the length of the already-processed jobs, i.e., the setup times are past-sequence-dependent (p-s-d). The objective functions are to minimize the sum of the quadratic job completion times, the total waiting time, the total weighted completion time, the maximum lateness, the total absolute differences in waiting times, and the sum of earliness penalties subject to no tardy jobs, respectively. We show that the sum of the quadratic job completion times minimization problem, the total waiting time minimization problem, the total absolute differences in waiting times minimization problem, and the sum of earliness penalties minimization problem subject to no tardy jobs can be solved in polynomial time, respectively. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under some special cases.

AB A general problem for human-machine interaction occurs when a machine's controllable dimensions outnumber the control channels available to its human user. In this work, we examine one prominent example of this problem: amputee switching between the multiple functions of a powered artificial limb. We propose a dynamic switching approach that learns during ongoing interaction to anticipate user behaviour, thereby presenting the most effective control option for a given context or task. Switching predictions are learned in real time using temporal difference methods and reinforcement learning, and demonstrated within the context of a robotic arm and a multi-function myoelectric controller. We find that a learned, dynamic switching order is able to out-perform the best fixed (non-adaptive) switching regime on a standard prosthetic proficiency task, increasing the number of optimal switching suggestions by 23%, and decreasing the expected transition time between degrees of freedom by more than 14%. These preliminary results indicate that real-time machine learning, specifically online prediction and anticipation, may be an important tool for developing more robust and intuitive controllers for assistive biomedical robots. We expect these techniques will transfer well to near-term use by patients. Future work will describe clinical testing of this approach with a population of amputee patients.

AB We propose a machine-learning based multi-level cognitive model inspired from early-ages' cognitive development of human's locomotion skills for humanoid robot's walking modeling. Contrary to the most of already introduced works dealing with biped robot's walking modeling, which place the problem within the context of controlling specific kinds of biped robots, the proposed model attends to a global concept of biped walking ability's construction independently front the robot to which the concept may be applied. The chief-benefit of the concept is that the issued machine-learning based structure takes advantage from "learning" capacity and "generalization" propensity of such models: allowing a precious potential to deal with high dimensionality, nonlinearity and empirical proprioceptive or exteroceptive information. Case studies and validation results are reported and discussed evaluating potential performances of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new set of 142 experimentally determined complexation constants between sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin and diverse organic guest molecules, and 78 observations reported in literature, were used for the development of the QSPR models by the two machine learning regression methods - Cubist and Random Forest. Similar models were built for beta-cyclodextrin using the 233-compound dataset available in the literature. These results demonstrate that the machine learning regression methods can successfully describe the complex formation between organic molecules and beta-cyclodextrin or sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin. In particular, the root mean square errors for the test sets predictions by the best models are low, 1.9 and 2.7 kJ/mol, respectively. The developed QSPR models can be used to predict the solubilizing effect of cyclodextrins and to help prioritizing experimental work in drug discovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Online prediction of mill load is useful to control system design in the grinding process. It is a challenging problem to estimate the parameters of the load inside the ball mill using measurable signals. This paper aims to develop a computational intelligence approach for predicting the mill load. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) are employed as learner models to implement the map between frequency spectral features and the mill load parameters. The inputs of the ELM model are reduced features, which are extracted and selected from the vibration frequency spectrum of the mill shell using partial least squares (PLS) algorithm. Experiments are carried out in the laboratory with comparisons on the well-known back-propagation learning algorithm, the original ELM and an optimization-based ELM (OELM). Results indicate that the reduced feature-based OELM can perform reasonably well at mill load parameter estimation, and it outperforms other learner models in terms of generalization capability.

The method takes a comprehensive considering on term frequency, term field, similarity with original ontology and other factors to extract key concept from texts, and then through Naive Bayes classifier compares those key concept with original ontology and extracts their relationships. We demonstrate that this research can ensure the requirement's reliability and improve the automation and intelligent on the process of requirements generation through simulation experiments and analysis of the results.

AB Stock market prediction has been a challenging task due to the nature of the data which is very noisy and time varying. However, this theory has been faced by many empirical studies and a number of researchers have successfully applied machine learning approaches to predict stock market. The problem studied here is about stock prediction for the use of investors. It is true investors usually get loss because of unclear investment objective and blind investment. This paper proposes to investigate the rough set model, the artificial neural network model and the hybrid artificial neural network model and the rough set model for determining the optimal buy and sell of a share on a Dhaka stock exchange. Confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the observed and predicted classes for selected models. Our experimental result shows that the proposed hybrid model has higher accuracy than the single rough set model and the artificial neural network model. We believe this paper will be useful to stock investors to determine the optimal buy and sell time on Dhaka Stock Exchange.

Under the proposed model, the learning effect is a general function of the processing time of jobs already processed and its scheduled position, and the setup time is past-sequence-dependent. We then derive the optimal sequences for two single-machine problems, which are the makespan and the total completion time. Moreover, we showed that the weighted completion time, the maximum lateness, the maximum tardiness, and the total tardiness problems remain polynomially solvable under agreeable conditions.

AB The need to quickly and accurately classify Internet traffic for various traffic shaping purposes and security reasons has been growing steadily. This is due to the many new applications that have been taken place in the field of Internet traffic. As conventional port number based and packet payload based methods are no longer adequate, pattern recognition by learning the statistical flow-based features in the training samples to classify the unknown flows has become popular. The applied method should be fast enough to identify the traffic type in real time before the entire flows are finished. This paper proposes a supervised machine learning based method to identify 7 different types of Internet applications. Our proposed system is able to detect the flows application types after observing just a few first packets in each flow in order to run in real time. The overall accuracy of 84.9% was achieved which is a promising result.

AB Comprehension assessment is an essential tool in classroom learning. However, the judgment often relies on experience of an instructor who makes observation of students' behavior during the lessons. We argue that students should report their own comprehension explicitly in a classroom. With students' comprehension made available at the slide level, we apply a machine learning technique to classify presentation slides according to comprehension levels. Our experimental result suggests that presentation-based features are as predictive as bag-of-words feature vector which is proved successful in text classification tasks. Our analysis on presentation-based features reveals possible causes of poor lecture comprehension.

AB As to learning effect, it may be more appropriate to assume that position-based learning takes place during machine setups only, while sum-of-processing-time-based learning occurs in considering the experience that workers have gained from producing jobs. Thus, in this paper, we consider sum-of-processing-time-based learning on job processing time and position-based learning on setup time in single-machine group scheduling problems. The objectives are to minimize the makespan and the total completion time, respectively. We provide two polynomial time algorithms to solve the makespan minimization problems. On the other hand, we also provide two polynomial time algorithms to solve the total completion time minimization problems under certain conditions.

AB In this work, a new human face recognition algorithm based on bidirectional two dimensional principal component analysis (B2DPCA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) is introduced. The proposed method is based on curvelet image decomposition of human faces and a subband that exhibits a maximum standard deviation is dimensionally reduced using an improved dimensionality reduction technique. Discriminative feature sets are generated using B2DPCA to ascertain classification accuracy. Other notable contributions of the proposed work include significant improvements in classification rate, up to hundred folds reduction in training time and minimal dependence on the number of prototypes. Extensive experiments are performed using challenging databases and results are compared against state of the art techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CONTENT-BASED RETRIEVAL; SYSTEM
AB Machine-learning research is often conducted in vitro, divorced from motivating practical applications. A researcher might develop a new method for the general task of classification, then assess its utility by comparing its performance (for example, accuracy or AUC) to that of existing classification models on publicly available data sets. In terms of advancing machine learning as an academic discipline, this approach has thus far proven quite fruitful. However, it is our view that the most interesting open problems in machine learning are those that arise during its application to real-world problems. We illustrate this point by reviewing two of our interdisciplinary collaborations, both of which have posed unique machine-learning problems, providing fertile ground for novel research.

AB In this paper we consider single-machine group scheduling problems with effects of learning and deterioration at the same time. By effects of learning and deterioration, we mean that the group setup times are general linear functions of their starting times and the jobs in the same group have general position-dependent and time-dependent learning effects. The objective of scheduling problems is to minimize the makespan and the sum of completion times, respectively. We show that the problems remain solvable in polynomial time under the proposed model.

AB Some existing studies of successful development of equipment industry emphasize the need to focus on formal channels of technology acquisition to allow latecomers to catch up. However, this reasoning neglects the fact that in some industries, including traditional equipment industry sectors, much knowledge can be acquired by informal means. Through the study of machine tool industry in China, this paper shows the significance of informal learning activities in the development of traditional industries and the possibility for latecomer firms to climb the technological ladder through exploiting various informal knowledge relationships.

AB High quality information on forest resources is important to forest ecosystem management. Traditional ground measurements are labor and resource intensive and at the same time expensive and time consuming. For most of the Slovenian forests, there is extensive ground-based information on forest properties of selected sample locations. However there is no continuous information of objectively measured vegetation height and canopy cover at appropriate resolution.
   Currently, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology provides detailed measurements of different forest properties because of its immediate generation of 3D data, its accuracy and acquisition flexibility. However, existing LiDAR sensors have limited spatial coverage and relatively high cost of acquisition. Satellite data, on the other hand, are low-cost and offer broader spatial coverage of generalized forest structure, but are not expected to provide accurate information about vegetation height.
   Integration of LiDAR and satellite data promises to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of forest properties. The primary objective of this study is to model the vegetation height and canopy cover in Slovenia by integrating LiDAR data, Landsat satellite data, and the use of machine learning techniques. This kind of integration uses the accuracy and precision of LiDAR data and the wide coverage of satellite data in order to generate cost-effective realistic estimates of the vegetation height and canopy cover, and consequently generate continuous forest vegetation map products to be used in forest management and monitoring.
   Several machine learning techniques are applied to this task: they are evaluated and their performance is compared by using statistical significance tests. Ensemble methods perform significantly better than single- and multi-target regression trees and are further used for the generation of forest maps. Such maps are used for land-cover and land-use classification, as well as for monitoring and managing ongoing forest processes (like spontaneous afforestation, forest reduction and forest fires) that affect the stability of forest ecosystems.

These parameters belong to the driver's model developed by AIDE (Adaptive Integrated Driver-vehicle InterfacE) European Integrated Project.
   Drivers' behavioural data have been collected from the Simulator tests to model and validate these parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and the artificial neural network (ANN). Two models of task demand and distraction have been developed, one for each adopted technique.
   The paper provides an overview of the driver's model, the description of the task demand and distraction modelling and the tests conducted for the validation of these parameters. A test comparing predicted and expected outcomes of the modelled parameters for each machine learning technique has been carried out: for distraction, in particular, promising results (low prediction errors) have been obtained by adopting an artificial neural network.

AB We develop a statistical machine learning framework to study the effect of eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution) on two output variables, namely heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL), of residential buildings. We systematically investigate the association strength of each input variable with each of the output variables using a variety of classical and non-parametric statistical analysis tools, in order to identify the most strongly related input variables. Then, we compare a classical linear regression approach against a powerful state of the art nonlinear non-parametric method, random forests, to estimate HL and CL Extensive simulations on 768 diverse residential buildings show that we can predict HL and CL with low mean absolute error deviations from the ground truth which is established using Ecotect (0.51 and 1.42, respectively). The results of this study support the feasibility of using machine learning tools to estimate building parameters as a convenient and accurate approach, as long as the requested query bears resemblance to the data actually used to train the mathematical model in the first place.

AB Thousands of machine learning research papers contain extensive experimental comparisons. However, the details of those experiments are often lost after publication, making it impossible to reuse these experiments in further research, or reproduce them to verify the claims made. In this paper, we present a collaboration framework designed to easily share machine learning experiments with the community, and automatically organize them in public databases. This enables immediate reuse of experiments for subsequent, possibly much broader investigation and offers faster and more thorough analysis based on a large set of varied results. We describe how we designed such an experiment database, currently holding over 650,000 classification experiments, and demonstrate its use by answering a wide range of interesting research questions and by verifying a number of recent studies.

AB Multi-view learning was supposed to process data with multiple information sources. Our previous work extended multi-view learning and proposed one effective learning machine named MultiV-MHKS. MultiV-MHKS firstly changed a base classifier into M different sub-classifiers, and then designed one joint learning process for the generated M sub-ones. Each sub-classifier was taken as one view of MultiV-MHKS. However, MultiV-MHKS assumed that each sub-classifier should play an equal role in the ensemble. Thus the weight values r(q), q =1 ... M for each sub-classifier were set to the equal value. In practice, this hypothesis was neither flexible nor appropriate since r(q)s should reflect different effects of their corresponding views. In order to make r(q)s flexible and appropriate, in this paper we propose a regularized multi-view learning machine named RMultiV-MHKS with the optimized r(q)s. In this case, we optimize r(q)s through using the Response Surface Technique (RST) on cross-validation data and thus can obtain a regularized multi-view learning machine. Doing so can assign a certain view with zero weight in the combination, which means that this specific view does not carry discriminative information for the problem and hence can be pruned. The experimental results here validate the effectiveness of the proposed RMultiV-MHKS and meanwhile explore the effect of some important parameters. The characters of the RMultiV-MHKS are: (1) distributing more weight to the favorable views which can reflect the property of the problem; (2) owning a tighter generalization risk bound than its corresponding single-view learning machine in terms of the Rademacher complexity; (3) having a statistically superior classification performance to the original MultiV-MHKS.

   never-ending learning system
AB The Machine Learning community have been introduced to NELL (Never-Ending Language Learning), a system able to learn from web and to use its knowledge to keep learning infinitely. The idea of continuously learning from the web brings concerns about reliability and accuracy, mainly when the learning process uses its own knowledge to improve its learning capabilities. Considering that the knowledge base keeps growing forever, such a system requires self-supervision as well as self-reflection. The increased use of the Internet, that allowed NELL creation, also brought a new source of information on-line. The social media becomes more popular everyday and the AI community can now develop research to take advantage of these information, aiming to turn it into knowledge. This work is following this lead and proposes a new machine learning approach, called Conversing Learning, to use collective knowledge from web community users to provide self-supervision and self-reflection to intelligent machines, thus, they can improve their learning task. The Conversing Learning approach explores concepts from Active Learning and Question Answering to achieve the goal of showing what can be done towards autonomous Human Computer Interaction to automatically improve machine learning tasks.

AB Adaptive feedback schemes are promising for quantum-enhanced measurements yet are complicated to design. Machine learning can autonomously generate algorithms in a classical setting. Here we adapt machine learning for quantum information and use our framework to generate autonomous adaptive feedback schemes for quantum measurement. In particular, our approach replaces guesswork in quantum measurement by a logical, fully automatic, programable routine. We show that our method yields schemes that outperform the best known adaptive scheme for interferometric phase estimation.

AB Infrared systems are key to providing enhanced capability to military forces such as automatic control of threats and prevention from air, naval and ground attacks. Key requirements for such a system to produce operational benefits are real-time processing as well as high efficiency in terms of detection and false alarm rate. These are serious issues since the system must deal with a large number of objects and categories to be recognized (small vehicles, armored vehicles, planes, buildings, etc.).
   Statistical learning based algorithms are promising candidates to meet these requirements when using selected discriminant features and real-time implementation. This paper proposes a new decision architecture benefiting from recent advances in machine learning by using an effective method for level set estimation. While building decision function, the proposed approach performs variable selection based on a discriminative criterion. Moreover, the use of level set makes it possible to manage rejection of unknown or ambiguous objects thus preserving the false alarm rate. Experimental evidences reported on real world infrared images demonstrate the validity of our approach.

AB In this article, we consider a single machine scheduling problem with a time-dependent learning effect and deteriorating jobs. By the effects of time-dependent learning and deterioration, we mean that the job processing time is defined by a function of its starting time and total normal processing time of jobs in front of it in the sequence. The objective is to determine an optimal schedule so as to minimize the total completion time. This problem remains open for the case of -1 < a < 0, where a denotes the learning index; we show that an optimal schedule of the problem is V-shaped with respect to job normal processing times. Three heuristic algorithms utilising the V-shaped property are proposed, and computational experiments show that the last heuristic algorithm performs effectively and efficiently in obtaining near-optimal solutions.

AB There is not a specific test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). Its diagnosis should be based upon clinical history, neuropsychological and laboratory tests, neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG). Therefore, new approaches are necessary to enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis and to follow treatment results. In this study we used a Machine Learning (ML) technique, named Support Vector Machine (SVM), to search patterns in EEG epochs to differentiate AD patients from controls. As a result, we developed a quantitative EEG (qEEG) processing method for automatic differentiation of patients with AD from normal individuals, as a complement to the diagnosis of probable dementia. We studied EEGs from 19 normal subjects (14 females/5 males, mean age 71.6 years) and 16 probable mild to moderate symptoms AD patients (14 females/2 males, mean age 73.4 years. The results obtained from analysis of EEG epochs were accuracy 79.9% and sensitivity 83.2%. The analysis considering the diagnosis of each individual patient reached 87.0% accuracy and 91.7% sensitivity.

AB With the increasing popularity of electronic mail, several persons and companies have found it an easy way to quickly disseminate unsolicited messages to a large number of users at very low costs for the senders. Consequently, unsolicited or spam e-mails have dramatically become a major threat that can negatively impact the usability of the electronic mail as a reliable communication means. Besides wasting considerable time and money for business users and network administrators, spam consumes network bandwidth and server storage space, slows down e-mail servers, and provides a medium to distribute harmful and/or offensive content. Hence, it has become an important and indispensable aspect of any recent e-mail system to incorporate a spam filtering subsystem. In this chapter, we present an overview of the spam filtering problem and survey the state-of-the-art of the proposed and deployed machine learning based methods. We begin with a brief review of potential spam threats for network users and resources, and some market analysis indicators of the spam growth rate. After that, we formally describe the machine learning spam filtering problem and discuss various approaches for representing e-mail messages and selecting relevant features. Then, we describe some common metrics and benchmark corpora for evaluating and comparing the performance of different learning methods for spam filtering. Next, we discuss various learning algorithms that have been applied to this problem and survey the related work. Finally, we present a case study to compare the performance of a number of these learning methods on one of the publicly available datasets.

An analysis using the integrated approach of new data with the existing models is evaluated. Identifying a compact set of genes from gene expression data is a critical step in bioinformatics research. Personalized modeling is a recently introduced technique for constructing clinical decision support systems. This is a novel study which utilises both computational and biological evidence and the use of a personalized modeling for the analysis of this disease. Directions for further studies are also outlined.

By using the. method, we could extract 160 thousand word pairs with a precision rate of 0.9. We also constructed a method using patterns in addition to machine learning and observed that we could extract 4.2 million notational variant pairs with a precision rate of 0.78. We confirmed that our method was much better than an existing method through experiments.

AB The web is becoming an increasingly important source of entertainment, communication, research, news and trade. In this way, the web sites compete to attract the attention of users and many of them achieve visibility through malicious strategies that try to circumvent the search engines. Such sites are known as web spam and they are generally responsible for personal injury and economic losses. Given this scenario, this paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of several established machine learning techniques used to automatically detect and filter hosts that disseminate web spam. Our experiments were diligently designed to ensure statistically sounds results and they indicate that bagging of decision trees, multilayer perceptron neural networks, random forest and adaptive boosting of decision trees are promising in the task of web spam classification and, hence, they can be used as a good baseline for further comparison.

   function network; Machine learning; Earliest deadline first
AB Due to limited resource contentions and deadline constraints, messages on the controller area network (CAN) are competing for service from the common resources. This problem can be resolved by assigning priorities to different message classes to satisfy time-critical applications. Actually, because of the fluctuation of network traffic or an inefficient use of resources, these static or dynamic priority policies may not guarantee flexibility for different kinds of messages in real-time scheduling. Consequently, the message transmission which cannot comply with the timing requirements or deadlines may deteriorate system performance significantly. In this paper, we have proposed a controller-plant model, where the plant is analogous to a message queue pool (MQP) and the message scheduling controller (MSC) is responsible to dispatch resources for queued messages according to the feedback information from the MQP. The message scheduling controller, which is realized by the radial basis function (RBF) network, is designed with machine learning algorithm to compensate the variations in plant dynamics. The MSC with the novel hybrid learning schemes can ensure a low and stable message waiting time variance (or a uniform distribution of waiting time) and lower transmission failures. A significant emphasis of the MSC is the variable structure of the RBF model to accommodate to complex scheduling situations. Simulation experiments have shown that several variants of the MSC significantly improve overall system performance over the static scheduling strategies and the dynamic earliest-deadline first (EDF) algorithms under a wide range of workload characteristics and execution environments.

AB Context: Software development effort estimation (SDEE) is the process of predicting the effort required to develop a software system. In order to improve estimation accuracy, many researchers have proposed machine learning (ML) based SDEE models (ML models) since 1990s. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way.
   Objective: This research aims to systematically analyze ML models from four aspects: type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context.
   Method: We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies on ML model published in the last two decades (1991-2010).
   Results: We have identified 84 primary studies relevant to the objective of this research. After investigating these studies, we found that eight types of ML techniques have been employed in SDEE models. Overall speaking, the estimation accuracy of these ML models is close to the acceptable level and is better than that of non-ML models. Furthermore, different ML models have different strengths and weaknesses and thus favor different estimation contexts.
   Conclusion: ML models are promising in the field of SDEE. However, the application of ML models in industry is still limited, so that more effort and incentives are needed to facilitate the application of ML models. To this end, based on the findings of this review, we provide recommendations for researchers as well as guidelines for practitioners. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Meta-learning is becoming more and more important in current and future research concentrated around broadly defined data mining or computational intelligence. It can solve problems that cannot be solved by any single, specialized algorithm. The overall characteristic of each meta-learning algorithm mainly depends on two elements: the learning machine space and the supervisory procedure. The former restricts the space of all possible learning machines to a subspace to be browsed by a meta-learning algorithm. The latter determines the order of selected learning machines with a module responsible for machine complexity evaluation, organizes tests and performs analysis of results. In this article we present a framework for meta-learning search that can be seen as a method of sophisticated description and evaluation of functional search spaces of learning machine configurations used in meta-learning. Machine spaces will be defined by specially defined graphs where vertices are specialized machine configuration generators. By using such graphs the learning machine space may be modeled in a much more flexible way, depending on the characteristics of the problem considered and a priori knowledge. The presented method of search space description is used together with an advanced algorithm which orders test tasks according to their complexities.

AB Objectives: Missing data imputation is an important task in cases where it is crucial to use all available data and not discard records with missing values. This work evaluates the performance of several statistical and machine learning imputation methods that were used to predict recurrence in patients in an extensive real breast cancer data set
   Materials and methods. Imputation methods based on statistical techniques, e.g., mean, hot-deck and multiple imputation, and machine learning techniques, e.g. multi-layer perceptron (MLP), self-organisation maps (SOM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), were applied to data collected through the "El Alamo-I" project, and the results were then compared to those obtained from the listwise deletion (LD) imputation method. The database includes demographic, therapeutic and recurrence-survival information from 3679 women with operable invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 32 different hospitals belonging to the Spanish Breast Cancer Research Group (GEICAM). The accuracies of predictions on early cancer relapse were measured using artificial neural networks (ANNs), in which different ANNs were estimated using the data sets with imputed missing values
   Results: The imputation methods based on machine learning algorithms outperformed imputation statistical methods in the prediction of patient outcome. Friedman's test revealed a significant difference (p = 0.0091) in the observed area under the ROC curve (AUC) values, and the pairwise comparison test showed that the AUCs for MLP, KNN and SOM were significantly higher (p = 00053, p = 0 0048 and p = 00071, respectively) than the AUC from the LD-based prognosis model.
   Conclusion: The methods based on machine learning techniques were the most suited for the imputation of missing values and led to a significant enhancement of prognosis accuracy compared to imputation methods based on statistical procedures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A method for the sparse solution of recurrent support vector regression machines is presented. The proposed method achieves a high accuracy versus complexity and allows the user to adjust the complexity of the resulting model. The sparse representation is guaranteed by limiting the number of training data points for the support vector regression method. Each training data point is selected based on the accuracy of the fully recurrent model using the active learning principle applied to the successive time-domain data. The user can adjust the training time by selecting how often the hyper-parameters of the algorithm should be optimised. The advantages of the proposed method are illustrated on several examples, and the experiments clearly show that it is possible to reduce the number of support vectors and to significantly improve the accuracy versus complexity of recurrent support vector regression machines.

AB We consider resource allocation scheduling with learning effect in which the processing time of a job is a function of its position in a sequence and its resource allocation. The objective is to find the optimal sequence of jobs and the optimal resource allocation separately. We concentrate on two goals separately, namely, minimizing a cost function containing makespan, total completion time, total absolute differences in completion times and total resource cost; minimizing a cost function containing makespan, total waiting time, total absolute differences in waiting times and total resource cost. We analyse the problem with two different processing time functions. For each combination of these, we provide a polynomial time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence and resource allocation.

AB The purpose of the current study is to test whether we could create a system where students can learn by teaching a live machine-learning agent, called SimStudent. SimStudent is a computer agent that interactively learns cognitive skills through its own tutored-problem solving experience. We have developed a game-like learning environment where students learn algebra equations by tutoring SimStudent. While Simulated Students, Teachable Agents and Learning Companion systems have been created, our study is unique that it genuinely learns skills from student input. This paper describes the overview of the learning environment and some results from an evaluation study. The study showed that after tutoring SimStudent, the students improved their performance on equation solving. The number of correct answers on the error detection items was also significantly improved. On average students spent 70.0 minutes on tutoring SimStudent and used an average of 15 problems for tutoring.

AB Several adaptation approaches have been devised to ensure end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) for enterprise distributed systems in dynamic operating environments. Not all approaches are applicable, however, for the stringent accuracy, timeliness, and development complexity requirements of distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. This paper empirically evaluates constant-time supervised machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), and presents a composite metric to support quantitative evaluation of accuracy and timeliness for these adaptation approaches.

DE review; transfer learning; machine learning
AB The machine learning plays the key roles in many artificial intelligence areas including classification, regression and clustering. The traditional machine learning methods assume that the training and test sample are drawn from the same feature space and the same distribution. With the change of the distribution, the traditional machine learning methods need to rebuild the models using newly collected training samples. In real world, it is impossible or expensive to recollect and label the needed training samples and rebuild the models. To address the problem, the transfer learning is proposed. This paper reviews four categories of transfer learning methods and their applications: transferring instances, transferring feature representations, transferring parameters and transferring relationship.

AB Nowadays major laboratories of the world are turning towards in-silico experimentation due to their ease, reproducibility and accuracy. The ethical issues concerning wet lab experimentations are also minimal in in-silico experimentations. But before we turn fully towards dry lab simulations it is necessary to understand the discrepancies and bottle necks involved with dry lab experimentations. It is necessary before reporting any result using dry lab simulations to perform in-depth statistical analysis of the data. Keeping same in mind here we are presenting a collaborative effort to correlate findings and results of various machine learning algorithms and checking underlying regressions and mutual dependencies so as to develop an optimal classifier and predictors.

AB Domestic energy demand accounts for about 30% of overall energy use. The IDEAL project uses a variety of IT methods to investigate whether, and in which social groups, feedback of personalised, household-specific and behaviour-specific information results in greater reduction in energy use than overall consumption information reported by Smart Meters. It is a sociotechnical study, concentrated on existing housing, with a strong social science component and an experimental design that looks at income levels and household composition as primary factors. Temperature and humidity data related to behaviour is gathered using a small number of wireless sensors in the home, together with data on weather, building factors and household composition. This data is streamed over the internet to servers where it is analysed using Bayesian machine-learning methods to extract household-specific behaviours in near-realtime. Information on the cost, carbon content and amount of energy used for specific behaviours is reported back to the householders via a dedicated wireless tablet. This interactive content is automatically generated using multimedia methods based on natural language generation techniques. The project is in its design phase, with the main project planned (and funded) to run 2013-2016. It is anticipated to demonstrate whether such low-cost sensing, analysis and feedback is significantly more effective than standard Smart Meters in reducing demand, and a business opportunity for green service organisations.

AB Resting state functional brain networks have been widely studied in brain disease research. However, it is currently unclear whether abnormal resting state functional brain network metrics can be used with machine learning for the classification of brain diseases. Resting state functional brain networks were constructed for 28 healthy controls and 38 major depressive disorder patients by thresholding partial correlation matrices of 90 regions. Three nodal metrics were calculated using graph theory-based approaches. Nonparametric permutation tests were then used for group comparisons of topological metrics, which were used as classified features in six different algorithms. We used statistical significance as the threshold for selecting features and measured the accuracies of six classifiers with different number of features. A sensitivity analysis method was used to evaluate the importance of different features. The result indicated that some of the regions exhibited significantly abnormal nodal centralities, including the limbic system, basal ganglia, medial temporal, and prefrontal regions. Support vector machine with radial basis kernel function algorithm and neural network algorithm exhibited the highest average accuracy (79.27 and 78.22%, respectively) with 28 features (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis between feature importance and the statistical significance of metrics was investigated, and the results revealed a strong positive correlation between them. Overall, the current study demonstrated that major depressive disorder is associated with abnormal functional brain network topological metrics and statistically significant nodal metrics can be successfully used for feature selection in classification algorithms.

AB This paper describes an automatic topic extraction, categorization, and relevance ranking model for multilingual surveys and questions that exploits machine learning algorithms such as topic modeling and fuzzy clustering. Automatically generated question and survey categories are used to build question banks and category-specific survey templates. First, we describe different pre-processing steps we considered for removing noise in the multilingual survey text. Second, we explain our strategy to automatically extract survey categories from surveys based on topic models. Third, we describe different methods to cluster questions under survey categories and group them based on relevance. Last, we describe our experimental results on a large group of unique, real-world survey datasets from the German, Spanish, French, and Portuguese languages and our refining methods to determine meaningful and sensible categories for building question banks. We conclude this document with possible enhancements to the current system and impacts in the business domain.

TI A Modular Machine Learning System for Flow-Level Traffic Classification

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA
LA English
DT Article
DE Communications network; traffic classification; machine learning
AB The ability to accurately and scalably classify network traffic is of critical importance to a wide range of management tasks of large networks, such as tier-1 ISP networks and global enterprise networks. Guided by the practical constraints and requirements of traffic classification in large networks, in this article, we explore the design of an accurate and scalable machine learning based flow-level traffic classification system, which is trained on a dataset of flow-level data that has been annotated with application protocol labels by a packet-level classifier. Our system employs a lightweight modular architecture, which combines a series of simple linear binary classifiers, each of which can be efficiently implemented and trained on vast amounts of flow data in parallel, and embraces three key innovative mechanisms, weighted threshold sampling, logistic calibration, and intelligent data partitioning, to achieve scalability while attaining high accuracy. Evaluations using real traffic data from multiple locations in a large ISP show that our system accurately reproduces the labels of the packet level classifier when runs on (unlabeled) flow records, while meeting the scalability and stability requirements of large ISP networks. Using training and test datasets that are two months apart and collected from two different locations, the flow error rates are only 3% for TCP flows and 0.4% for UDP flows. We further show that such error rates can be reduced by combining the information of spatial distributions of flows, or collective traffic statistics, during classification. We propose a novel two-step model, which seamlessly integrates these collective traffic statistics into the existing traffic classification system. Experimental results display performance improvement on all traffic classes and an overall error rate reduction by 15%. In addition to a high accuracy, at runtime, our implementation easily scales to classify traffic on 10Gbps links.

AB In this chapter we first define the field of inductive machine learning and then describe Michalski's basic AQ algorithm. Next, we describe two of our machine learning algorithms, the CLIP4: a hybrid of rule and decision tree algorithms, and the DataSqeezer: a rule algorithm. The development of the latter two algorithms was inspired to a large degree by Michalski's seminal paper on inductive machine learning (1969). To many researchers, including the authors, Michalski is a "father" of inductive machine learning, as Lukasiewicz is of multivalued logic (extended much later to fuzzy logic) (Lukasiewicz, 1920), and Pawlak of rough sets (1991). Michalski was the first to work on inductive machine learning algorithms that generate rules, which will be explained via describing his AQ algorithm (1986).

In this paper, the effects of learning and deterioration are considered simultaneously. By the effects of learning and deterioration. we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by increasing function of its execution start time and position in the sequence. This study shows that optimal solution for ET scheduling problem under effects of learning and deterioration is V-shape schedule under certain agreeable conditions. Furthermore, we present a mathematical model for the problem under study and an algorithm for solving large test problems. The algorithm can solve problems of 1000 jobs and four machines within 3 s on average. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The tensor kernel has been used across the machine learning literature for a number of purposes and applications, due to its ability to incorporate samples from multiple sources into a joint kernel defined feature space. Despite these uses, there have been no attempts made towards investigating the resulting tensor weight in respect to the contribution of the individual tensor sources. Motivated by the increase in the current availability of Neuroscience data, specifically for two-source analyses, we propose a novel approach for decomposing the resulting tensor weight into its two components without accessing the feature space. We demonstrate our method and give experimental results on paired fMRI image-stimuli data.

DE Automatic evaluation; Second language writing; Machine learning
AB An automatic evaluation system for second language (L2) writing can be constructed by machine learning algorithms. The machine learning algorithms generally need a large amount of L2 learner sentences as training data for constructing an automatic evaluation system. Even though various L2 learner corpora have been developed, it is still not easy to obtain a large amount of L2 learner sentences. A solution for this problem is to substitute machine translation (MT) sentences for L2 learner sentences, because MT sentences involve errors such that L2 learners often make. In this paper, we examine whether MT sentences can be used as alternative training data for L2 learner sentences. Given this, we constructed automatic evaluation systems: one is constructed with L2 learner sentences as training data and the other is constructed with MT sentences as training data. We compared these systems, and assessed the validity of these evaluation systems. Through the experiment, we found that MT sentences differ from L2 learner sentences for the adequacy of training data.

In this paper, we introduce a method to regularize restricted Boltzmann machines during training to obtain features that are sparse and topographically organized. Upon analysis, the features learned are Gabor-like and demonstrate a coding of orientation, spatial position, frequency and color that vary smoothly with the topography of the feature map. There is also differentiation between monochrome and color filters, with some exhibiting color-opponent properties. We also found that the learned representation is more invariant to affine image transformations and changes in illumination color.

AB Given the non-existence of a standard quality index for ornamental slate, granite and marble blocks, classical classification methods such as Bieniawski's rock mass rating (RMR) and Barton's Q System are typically used, very much unquestioningly and indiscriminately. These methods, however, were originally designed for a different purpose, namely to identify and solve stability problems in underground excavations. Furthermore, they rely on pre-established parametric formulas that do not necessarily coincide in terms of criteria with rock quality experts. In fact, the fit between both perspectives has never been properly evaluated. In this article, we propose a quality index for ornamental rock constructed using machine learning techniques (support vector machines (SVMs)) to model the quality grade allocation procedure as applied by the expert. This quality index is composed of a set of logical rules consisting of mathematical inequalities in relevant ornamental quality variables. Nonetheless, the fact that the SVMs have the drawback of being difficult to interpret complicates the process of extracting the quality rules used by an expert. To overcome this drawback, we used classification and regression trees (CARTs) trained using SVM output.

DE Segmentation; Machine Learning; White Matter Lesion; Region of Interest;
   Weak Label
AB We propose a fast, learning-based algorithm for segmenting white matter (WM) lesions for magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. The inputs to the algorithm are T1, T2, and FLAIR images. Unlike most of the previously reported learning-based algorithms, which treat expert labeled lesion map as ground truth in the training step, the proposed algorithm only requires the user to provide a few regions of interest (ROI's) containing lesions. An unsupervised clustering algorithm is applied to segment these ROI's into areas. Based on the assumption that lesion voxels have higher intensity on FLAIR image, areas corresponding to lesions are identified and their probability distributions in T1, T2, and FLAIR images are computed. The lesion segmentation in 3D is done by using the probability distributions to generate a confidence map of lesion and applying a graph based segmentation algorithm to label lesion voxels. The initial lesion label is used to further refine the probability distribution estimation for the final lesion segmentation. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are: 1. By using the weak labels, we reduced the dependency of the segmentation performance on the expert discrimination of lesion voxels in the training samples; 2. The training can be done using labels generated by users with only general knowledge of brain anatomy and image characteristics of WM lesion, instead of these carefully labeled by experienced radiologists; 3. The algorithm is fast enough to make interactive segmentation possible. We test the algorithm on nine ACCORD-MIND MRI datasets. Experimental results show that our algorithm agrees well with expert labels and outperforms a support vector machine based WM lesion segmentation algorithm.

AB In this paper, we propose a nonconvex online Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm (LASVM-NC) based on the Ramp Loss, which has the strong ability of suppressing the influence of outliers. Then, again in the online learning setting, we propose an outlier filtering mechanism (LASVM-I) based on approximating nonconvex behavior in convex optimization. These two algorithms are built upon another novel SVM algorithm (LASVM-G) that is capable of generating accurate intermediate models in its iterative steps by leveraging the duality gap. We present experimental results that demonstrate the merit of our frameworks in achieving significant robustness to outliers in noisy data classification where mislabeled training instances are in abundance. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approaches yield a more scalable online SVM algorithm with sparser models and less computational running time, both in the training and recognition phases, without sacrificing generalization performance. We also point out the relation between nonconvex optimization and min-margin active learning.

AB Diversity among base classifiers is an important factor for improving in ensemble learning performance. In this paper, we choose support vector machine as base classifier and study four methods of selective ensemble learning which include hill-climbing, ensemble forward sequential selection, ensemble backward sequential selection and clustering selection. To measure the diversity among base classifiers in ensemble learning, the entropy E is used. The experimental results show that different diversity measure impacts on ensemble performance in some extent and first three selective strategies have similar generalization performance. Meanwhile, when using clustering selective strategy, selecting different number of clusters in this experiment also does not impact on the ensemble performance except some dataset.

AB E-mails to government institutions as well as to large companies may contain a large proportion of queries that can be answered in a uniform way. We analysed and manually annotated 4,404 e-mails from citizens to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. and compared two methods for detecting answerable e-mails: manually-created text patterns (rule-based) and machine learning-based methods. We found that the text pattern-based method gave much higher precision at 89 percent than the machine learning-based method that gave only 63 percent precision. The recall was slightly higher (66 percent) for the machine learning-based methods than for the text patterns (47 percent). We also found that 23 percent of the total e-mail flow was processed by the automatic e-mail answering system.

This paper introduces an automated meta-learning technique that learns to predict the best performing machine learning technique for each patient. The individually selected machine learning technique is then used for prognosis for the given patient. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated over a database of retrospective records of pancreatic cancer resections.

AB Meta-learning has many aspects, but its final goal is to discover in an automatic way many interesting models for a given data. Our early attempts in this area involved heterogeneous learning systems combined with a complexity-guided search for optimal models, performed within the framework of (dis)similarity based methods to discover "knowledge granules". This approach, inspired by neurocognitive mechanisms of information processing in the brain, is generalized here to learning based on parallel chains of transformations that extract useful information granules and use it as additional features. Various types of transformations that generate hidden features are analyzed and methods to generate them are discussed. They include restricted random projections, optimization of these features using projection pursuit methods, similarity-based and general kernel-based features, conditionally defined features, features derived from partial successes of various learning algorithms, and using the whole learning models as new features. In the enhanced feature space the goal of learning is to create image of the input data that can be directly handled by relatively simple decision processes. The focus is on hierarchical methods for generation of information, starting from new support features that are discovered by different types of data models created on similar tasks and successively building more complex features on the enhanced feature spaces. Resulting algorithms facilitate deep learning, and also enable understanding of structures present in the data by visualization of the results of data transformations and by creating logical, fuzzy and prototype-based rules based on new features. Relations to various machine-learning approaches, comparison of results, and neurocognitive inspirations for meta-learning are discussed.

AB Infrared spectroscopy has been a workhorse technique for materials analysis and can result in positively identifying many different types of material. In recent years there have been reports using wavelet analysis and machine learning algorithms to extract features of Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). The machine learning algorithms contain back-propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and support vector machine (SVM). This article reviews the important advances in FTIR analysis employing a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and machine learning algorithms, especially in the applications of the method for Chinese medicine identification, plant classification, and cancer diagnosis.

DE online incremental SVM; incremental learning; large-scale data
AB Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have gained outstanding generalization in many fields. However, standard SVM and most modified SVMs are in essence batch learning, which makes them unable to handle incremental learning well. Also, such SVMs are not able to handle large-scale data effectively because they are costly in terms of memory and computing consumption. In some situations, plenty of Support Vectors (SVs) are produced, which generally means a long testing time. In this paper, we propose an online incremental learning SVM for large data sets. The proposed method mainly consists of two components, Learning Prototypes (LPs) and Learning SVs (LSVs). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective for incremental learning problems and large-scale problems.

AB There is a general consensus that the movement of electricity price is crucial for electricity market. As a practical tool to estimate the future prices, electricity price forecast is of great importance and use for the operations of market participants. So a hybrid forecast model is proposed in this paper that integrates independent component analysis (ICA) with least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). First, a novel feature extraction method of price influence factors is proposed based on ICA, which aims at mining the latent source-features by using the higher-ordered statistical characteristics. After that, nonlinear regression modeling of electricity price and its extracted features is accomplished by LS-SVM with more efficient training and forecasting. Finally, Californian market data are employed to test the proposed approach.

AB For least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) the lack of sparse, while the standard sparse algorithm exist a problem that it need to mark all of training data. We propose an active learning algorithm based on LSSVM to solve sparse problem. This method first construct a minimum classification LSSVM, and then calculate the uncertainty of the sample, select the closest category to mark the sample surface, and finally joined the training set of labeled samples and the establishment of a new classifier, repeat the process until the model accuracy to meet Requirements. 6 provided in the UCI data sets on the experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the sparsity of LSSVM, and can reduce the cost labeled samples.

AB The estimation of a wind farm's power curve, which links the wind speed to the power that is produced by the whole wind farm, is a challenging task because this relationship is nonlinear and bounded, in addition to being non-stationary due for example to changes in the site environment and seasonality. Even for a single wind turbine the measured power at different wind speeds is generally different than the rated power, since the operating conditions on site are generally different than the conditions under which the turbine was calibrated (the wind speed on site is not uniform horizontally across the face of the turbine; the vertical wind profile and the air density are different than during the calibration; the wind data available on site are not always measured at the height of the turbine's hub).
   The paper presents a data-driven approach for building an equivalent steady state model of a wind farm under normal operating conditions and shows its utilization for the creation of quality control charts at the aim of detecting anomalous functioning conditions of the wind farm. We use and compare three different machine learning models - viz. a self-supervised neural network called GMR (Generalized Mapping Regressor), a feed-forward Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) - to estimate the relationship between the wind speed and the generated power in a wind farm. GMR is a novel incremental self-supervised neural network which can approximate every multidimensional function or relation presenting any kind of discontinuity; MLPs are the most widely used state-of-the-art neural network models and GRNNs belong to the family of kernel neural networks.
   The methodology allows the creation of a non-parametric model of the power curve that can be used as a reference profile for on-line monitoring of the power generation process, as well as for power forecasts. The results obtained show that the non-parametric approach provides fair performances, provided that a suitable pre-processing of the input data is accomplished. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a novel learning methodology is presented and discussed with reference to the application of virtual sensors in the semiconductor manufacturing environment. Density estimation techniques are used jointly with Renyi's entropy to define a loss function for the learning problem (relying on Information Theoretic Learning concepts). Furthermore, Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) theory is employed to handle nonlinearities and include regularization capabilities in the model. The proposed algorithm allows to estimate the structure of the predictive model, as well as the associated probabilistic uncertainty, in a nonparametric fashion. The methodology is then validated using simulation studies and process data from the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The proposed approach proves to be especially effective in strongly nongaussian environments and presents notable outlier filtering capabilities.

AB Handwriting recognition is a process of recognizing handwritten text on a paper in the case of offline handwriting recognition and on a tablet in the case of online handwriting recognition and converting it into an editable text. In this chapter, the authors focus on offline handwriting recognition, which means that recognition system accepts a scanned handwritten page as an input and outputs an editable recognized text. Handwriting recognition has been an active research area for more than four decades, but some of the major problems still remained unsolved. Many techniques, including the machine learning techniques, have been used to improve the accuracy. This chapter focuses on describing the problems of handwriting recognition and presents the solutions using machine learning techniques for solving major problems in handwriting recognition. The chapter also reviews and presents the state of the art techniques with results and future research for improving handwriting recognition.

AB Traffic classification becomes more challenging since the traditional techniques such as port numbers or deep packet inspection are ineffective against voice over IP (VoIP) applications, which uses non-standard ports and encryption. Statistical information based on network layer with the use of machine learning (ML) can achieve high classification accuracy and produce transportable signatures. However, the ability of ML to find transportable signatures depends mainly on the training data sets. In this paper, we explore the importance of sampling training data sets for the ML algorithms, specifically Genetic Programming, C5.0, Naive Bayesian and AdaBoost, to find transportable signatures. To this end, we employed two techniques for sampling network training data sets, namely random sampling and consecutive sampling. Results show that random sampling and 90-minute consecutive sampling have the best performance in terms of accuracy using C5.0 and SBB, respectively. In terms of complexity, the size of C5.0 solutions increases as the training size increases, whereas SBB finds simpler solutions.

AB In this paper a machine learning approach is applied to Automatic Term Recognition (ATR). Similar approaches have been successfully used in Automatic Keyword Extraction (AKE). Using a dataset consisting of Swedish patent texts and validated terms belonging to these texts, unigrams and bigrams are extracted and annotated with linguistic and statistical feature values. Experiments using a varying ratio between positive and negative examples in the training data are conducted using the annotated n-grams. The results indicate that a machine learning approach is viable for ATR. Furthermore, a machine learning approach for bilingual ATR is discussed. Preliminary analysis however indicate that some modifications have to be made to apply the monolingual machine learning approach to a bilingual context.

AB In traditional scheduling problems, the processing time for the given job is assumed to be a constant regardless of whether the job is scheduled earlier or later. However, the phenomenon named "learning effect" has extensively been studied recently, in which job processing times decline as workers gain more experience. This paper discusses a bi-criteria scheduling problem in an m-machine permutation flowshop environment with varied learning effects on different machines. The objective of this paper is to minimize the weighted sum of the total completion time and the makespan. A dominance criterion and a lower bound are proposed to accelerate the branch-and-bound algorithm for deriving the optimal solution. In addition, the near-optimal solutions are derived by adapting two well-known heuristic algorithms. The computational experiments reveal that the proposed branch-and-bound algorithm can effectively deal with problems with up to 16 jobs, and the proposed heuristic algorithms can yield accurate near-optimal solutions.

AB The development of MRI measures as biomarkers for neurodegenerative disease could prove extremely valuable for the assessment of neuroprotective therapies. Much current research is aimed at developing such biomarkers for use in people who are gene-positive for Huntington's disease yet exhibit few or no clinical symptoms of the disease (pre-HD). We acquired structural (T1), diffusion weighted and functional MRI ( fMRI) data from 39 pre-HD volunteers and 25 age-matched controls. To determine whether it was possible to decode information about disease state from neuroimaging data, we applied multivariate pattern analysis techniques to several derived voxel-based and segmented region-based datasets. We found that different measures of structural, diffusion weighted, and functional MRI could successfully classify pre-HD and controls using support vector machines (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with up to 76% accuracy. The model producing the highest classification accuracy used LDA with a set of six volume measures from the basal ganglia. Furthermore, using support vector regression (SVR) and linear regression models, we were able to generate quantitative measures of disease progression that were significantly correlated with established measures of disease progression (estimated years to clinical onset, derived from age and genetic information) from several different neuroimaging measures. The best performing regression models used SVR with neuroimaging data from regions within the grey matter (caudate), white matter (corticospinal tract), and fMRI (insular cortex). These results highlight the utility of machine learning analyses in addition to conventional ones. We have shown that several neuroimaging measures contain multivariate patterns of information that are useful for the development of disease-state biomarkers for HD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Business development is vital for any firms. However, globalization and the rapid development of technologies have made it difficult to find appropriate business partners such as suppliers and customers, and build reciprocal relationships among them, while it simultaneously offers many opportunities. In this contribution, we propose AI-based approach to find plausible candidates of business partners using firm profiles and transactional relationships among them. We employ machine learning techniques to build a prediction model of customer-supplier relationships. We applied our approach to the large amount of actual business data. The results showed that our approach successfully found potential business partners with F-values of about 84% and reciprocity among them with F-values of about 77%. Using our method, we also developed the Web-based system that helps people in actual businesses to find their new business partners. These contribute to developing one's own business in the complicated, specialized and rapidly changing business environments of recent years. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, machine learning techniques are used to enhance the performances of conventional Web proxy caching policies such as Least-Recently-Used (LRU), Greedy-Dual-Size (GDS) and Greedy-Dual-Size-Frequency (GDSF). A support vector machine (SVM) and a decision tree (C4.5) are intelligently incorporated with conventional Web proxy caching techniques to form intelligent caching approaches known as SVM-LRU. SVM-GDSF and C4.5-GDS. The proposed intelligent approaches are evaluated by trace-driven simulation and compared with the most relevant Web proxy caching polices. Experimental results have revealed that the proposed SVM-LRU, SVM-GDSF and C4.5-GDS significantly improve the performances of LRU, GDSF and GDS respectively.

AB In this paper we consider the single machine past-sequence-dependent (p-s-d) setup times scheduling problems with general position-dependent and time-dependent learning effects. By the general position-dependent and time-dependent learning effects, we mean that the actual processing time of a job is not only a function of the total normal processing times of the jobs already processed, but also a function of the job's scheduled position. The setup times are proportional to the length of the already processed jobs. We consider the following objective functions: the makespan, the total completion time, the sum of the 0th (0 >= 0) power of job completion times, the total lateness, the total weighted completion time, the maximum lateness, the maximum tardiness and the number of tardy jobs. We show that the problems of makespan, the total completion time, the sum of the 0th (0 >= 0) power of job completion times and the total lateness can be solved by the smallest (normal) processing time first (SPT) rule, respectively. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem, the maximum lateness minimization problem, maximum tardiness minimization problem and the number of tardy jobs minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions.

AB Harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose an enormous threat to the U. S. marine habitation and economy in the coastal waters. Federal and state coastal administrators have been devising a state-of-the-art monitoring and forecasting system for these HAB events. The efficacy of a monitoring and forecasting system relies on the performance of HAB detection. We propose a machine learning based spatio-temporal data mining approach for the detection of HAB events in the region of the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, a spatio-temporal cubical neighborhood around the training sample is introduced to retrieve relevant spectral information of both HAB and non-HAB classes. The feature relevance is studied through mutual information criterion to understand the important features in classifying HABs from non-HABs. Kernel based support vector machine is used as a classifier in the detection of HABs. This approach gives a significant performance improvement by reducing the false alarm rate. Further, with the achieved classification accuracy, the seasonal variations and sequential occurrence of algal blooms are predicted from spatio-temporal datasets. New variability visualization is introduced to illustrate the dynamic behavior of HABs across space and time.

AB We present a single-machine problem with the unequal release times under learning effect and deteriorating jobs when the objective is minimizing the makespan. In this study, we introduced a scheduling model with unequal release times in which both job deterioration and learning exist simultaneously. By the effects of learning and deterioration, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by increasing function of its execution start time and position in the sequence. A branch-and-bound algorithm incorporating with several dominance properties and lower bounds is developed to derive the optimal solution. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain a near-optimal solution. The computational experiments show that the branch-and-bound algorithm can solve instances up to 30 jobs, and the average error percentage of the proposed heuristic is less than 0.16%.

AB In this research, machine learning algorithms were compared in a landslide-susceptibility assessment. Given the input set of GIS layers for the Starca Basin, which included geological, hydrogeological, morphometric, and environmental data, a classification task was performed to classify the grid cells to: (i) landslide and non-landslide cases, (ii) different landslide types (dormant and abandoned, stabilized and suspended, reactivated). After finding the optimal parameters, C4.5 decision trees and Support Vector Machines were compared using kappa statistics. The obtained results showed that classifiers were able to distinguish between the different landslide types better than between the landslide and non-landslide instances. In addition, the Support Vector Machines classifier performed slightly better than the C4.5 in all the experiments. Promising results were achieved when classifying the grid cells into different landslide types using 20% of all the available landslide data for the model creation, reaching kappa values of about 0.65 for both algorithms.

AB Contemporary and water resources engineering and management rely increasingly on pattern recognition techniques that have the ability to capitalize on the unrelenting accumulation of data that is made possible by modern information technology and remote sensing methods. In response to the growing information needs of modern water systems, advanced computational models and tools have been devised to identify and extract relevant information from the mass of data that is now available. This chapter presents innovative applications from computational learning science within the fields of hydrology, hydrogeology, hydroclimatology, and water management. The success of machine learning is evident from the growing number of studies involving the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Relevance Vector Machines (RVM), and Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) to address various issues in hydrologic sciences. The applications that will be discussed within the chapter employ the machine learning techniques mentioned above for intelligent modeling of reservoir operations, temporal downscaling of precipitation, spatial downscaling of soil moisture and evapotranspiration, comparisons of various techniques for groundwater quality modeling, and forecasting of chaotic time series behavior. Combinatorial algorithms to capture the intrinsic complexities in the modeled phenomena and to overcome disparate scales are developed; for example, learning machines have been coupled with geostatistical techniques, non-homogenous hidden Markov models, wavelets, and evolutionary computing techniques. This chapter does not intend to be exhaustive; it reviews the progress that has been made over the past decade in the use of learning machines in applied hydrologic sciences and presents a summary of future needs and challenges for further advancement of these methods.

AB Hand gesture recognition for human computer interaction is an area of active research in computer vision and machine learning. The primary goal of gesture recognition research is to create a system, which can identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. This paper presents a comparative study of four classification algorithms for static hand gesture classification using two different hand features data sets. The approach used consists in identifying hand pixels in each frame, extract features and use those features to recognize a specific hand pose. The results obtained proved that the ANN had a very good performance and that the feature selection and data preparation is an important phase in the all process, when using low-resolution images like the ones obtained with the camera in the current work.

AB Objective: This work presents a system for a simultaneous non-invasive estimate of the blood glucose level (BGL) and the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, using a photoplethysmograph (PPG) and machine learning techniques. The method is independent of the person whose values are being measured and does not need calibration over time or subjects.
   Methodology: The architecture of the system consists of a photoplethysmograph sensor, an activity detection module, a signal processing module that extracts features from the PPG waveform, and a machine learning algorithm that estimates the SBP, DBP and BGL values. The idea that underlies the system is that there is functional relationship between the shape of the PPG waveform and the blood pressure and glucose levels.
   Results: As described in this paper we tested this method on 410 individuals without performing any personalized calibration. The results were computed after cross validation. The machine learning techniques tested were: ridge linear regression, a multilayer perceptron neural network, support vector machines and random forests. The best results were obtained with the random forest technique. In the case of blood pressure, the resulting coefficients of determination for reference vs. prediction were R-SBP(2) = 0.91, R-DBP(2) = 0.89, and R-BGL(2) = 0.90. For the glucose estimation, distribution of the points on a Clarke error grid placed 87.7% of points in zone A, 10.3% in zone B. and 1.9% in zone D. Blood pressure values complied with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society.
   Conclusion: An effective system for estimate of blood glucose and blood pressure from a photoplethysmograph is presented. The main advantage of the system is that for clinical use it complies with the grade B protocol of the British Hypertension society for the blood pressure and only in 1.9% of the cases did not detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

AB This paper deals with a bi-criteria single machine scheduling problem with a time-dependent learning effect and release times. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the makespan and the total completion time. The problem is NP-hard, thus a mixed integer non-linear programming formulation is presented, and a set of dominance properties are developed. To solve the problem efficiently, a procedure is then proposed by incorporating the dominance properties with an ant colony optimization algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, artificial ants construct solutions as orders of jobs based on the heuristic information as well as pheromone trails. Then, the dominance properties are added to obtain better solutions. To evaluate the algorithm performance, computational experiments are conducted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel incremental learning method called online independent Lagrangian support vector machine (OILSVM) is proposed. It achieves comparable classification accuracy with benchmark Lagrangian support vector machine (LSVM), while still enjoying the time efficiency of online learning machines. As opposed to the newly proposed OLSVM that utilizes the KKT conditions as data selection strategy, the size of the solution obtained by OILSVM using a linear independence check is always bounded, which implies bounded memory requirements, training and testing time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OILSVM.

AB Accurate segmentation of Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) from MR images is important for sub-typing in diagnosis, determining tumor margins in surgical planning, and selecting appropriate therapies. However, it is a challenging and time-consuming task because GBM has a variety of imaging characteristics and often deforms nearby tissues in the brain. In this paper, we propose a support vector machine (SVM) active learning approach to address the problem of GBM segmentation from multi-modal MR images. First, a knowledge-based fuzzy clustering algorithm is performed to segment the brain tissues into six classes including white matter (WM), grey matter (GM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), T2-hyperintense regions, necrosis and enhanced tumor. Then, the SVM active learning approach is applied to refine the segmentation. Comparative studies with other segmentation methods indicate that the proposed algorithm can segment GBM more accurately.

AB Virtualization is commonly used to efficiently operate servers in datacenters. The autonomic management of virtual machines enhances the advantages of virtualization. For the development of such management, it is important to establish a method to accurately detect performance degradation in virtual machines. This paper proposes a method that detects degradation via the passive measurement of traffic exchanged by virtual machines. Using passive traffic measurement is advantageous because it is robust against heavy loads, nonintrusive to the managed machines, and independent of hardware/software platforms. From the measured traffic metrics, performance state is determined by a machine learning technique that algorithmically determines the complex relationship between traffic metrics and performance degradation from training data. Moreover, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are confirmed experimentally.

AB Machine learning (ML) has become a popular tool for mining functional neuroimaging data, and there are now hopes of performing such analyses efficiently in real-time. Towards this goal, we compared accuracy of six different ML algorithms applied to neuroimaging data of persons engaged in a bivariate task, asserting their belief or disbelief of a variety of propositional statements. We performed unsupervised dimension reduction and automated feature extraction using independent component (IC) analysis and extracted IC time courses. Optimization of classification hyperparameters across each classifier occurred prior to assessment. Maximum accuracy was achieved at 92% for Random Forest, followed by 91% for AdaBoost, 89% for Naive Bayes, 87% for a J48 decision tree, 86% for K* and 84% for support vector machine. For real-time decoding applications, finding a parsimonious subset of diagnostic ICs might be useful. We used a forward search technique to sequentially add ranked ICs to the feature subspace. For the current data set, we determined that approximately six ICs represented a meaningful basis set for classification. We then projected these six IC spatial maps forward onto a later scanning session within subject. We then applied the optimized ML algorithms to these new data instances, and found that classification accuracy results were reproducible. Additionally, we compared our classification method to our previously published general linear model results on this same data set. The highest ranked IC spatial maps show similarity to brain regions associated with contrasts for belief > disbelief, and disbelief < belief. 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID TEXT CATEGORIZATION; CLASSIFICATION
AB A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.

AB The International Planning Competition is a biennial event organized in the context of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling. The 2008 competition included, for the first time, a learning track for comparing approaches for improving automated planners via learning. In this paper, we describe the structure of the learning track, the planning domains used for evaluation, the participating systems, the results, and our observations. Towards supporting the goal of domain-independent learning, one of the key features of the competition was to disallow any code changes or parameter tweaks after the training domains were revealed to the participants. The competition results show that at this stage no learning for planning system outperforms state-of-the-art planners in a domain independent manner across a wide range of domains. However, they appear to be close to providing such performance. Evaluating learning for planning systems in a blind competition raises important questions concerning criteria that should be taken into account in future competitions.

AB Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to discover method-specific compilation strategies in Testarossa, a commercial Just-in-Time (JiT) compiler employed in the IBM (R) J9 Java (TM) Virtual Machine. The learning process explores a large number of different compilation strategies to generate the data needed for training models. The trained machine-learned model is integrated with the compiler to predict a compilation plan that balances code quality and compilation effort on a per-method basis. The machine-learned plans outperform the original Testarossa for start-up performance, but not for throughput performance, for which Testarossa has been highly hand-tuned for many years.

AB Establishing metrics to assess machine translation (MT) systems automatically is now crucial owing to the widespread use of MT over the web. In this study we show that such evaluation can be done by modeling text as complex networks. Specifically, we extend our previous work by employing additional metrics of complex networks, whose results were used as input for machine learning methods and allowed MT texts of distinct qualities to be distinguished. Also shown is that the node-to-node mapping between source and target texts (English-Portuguese and Spanish-Portuguese pairs) can be improved by adding further hierarchical levels for the metrics out-degree, in-degree, hierarchical common degree, cluster coefficient, inter-ring degree, intra-ring degree and convergence ratio. The results presented here amount to a proof-of-principle that the possible capturing of a wider context with the hierarchical levels may be combined with machine learning methods to yield an approach for assessing the quality of MT systems.

AB This paper deals with single-machine scheduling problems with a more general learning effect based on sum-of-processing-time. In this study, sum-of-processing-time-based learning effect means that the processing time of a job is defined by a decreasing function of the total normal processing time of jobs that come before it in the sequence. Results show that even with the introduction of the sum-of-processing-time-based learning effect to job processing times, single-machine makespan minimization problems remain polynomially solvable. The curves of the optimal schedule of a total completion time minimization problem are V-shaped with respect to job normal processing times.

AB Online learning is a machine learning paradigm that is useful when data is not available all at once. In this paper we focus in real time applications for which data is being collected as the algorithm executes. The forgetron Algorithm [1] is an online learning algorithm that works under a limited memory constraint while guaranteeing a bound on the number of total mistakes. We have proposed a specific architecture for the forgetron algorithm using hardware/software based design in order to improve computation time in the training process. Experiments on real world data show the advantages of this implementation compared to an exclusive software implementation using a Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA with an embedded Power PC. These experiments validate the performance of the proposed architecture.

AB We present a polarisable multipolar interatomic electrostatic potential energy function for force fields and describe its application to the pilot molecule MeNH-Ala-COMe (AlaD). The total electrostatic energy associated with 1, 4 and higher interactions is partitioned into atomic contributions by application of quantum chemical topology (QCT). The exact atom-atom interaction is expressed in terms of atomic multipole moments. The machine learning method Kriging is used to model the dependence of these multipole moments on the conformation of the entire molecule. The resulting models are able to predict the QCT-partitioned multipole moments for arbitrary chemically relevant molecular geometries. The interaction energies between atoms are predicted for these geometries and compared to their true values. The computational expense of the procedure is compared to that of the point charge formalism.

ID CELLCLASSIFIER
AB Imaging-based high-content screens often rely on single cell-based evaluation of phenotypes in large data sets of microscopic images. Traditionally, these screens are analyzed by extracting a few image-related parameters and use their ratios (linear single or multiparametric separation) to classify the cells into various phenotypic classes. In this study, the authors show how machine learning-based classification of individual cells outperforms those classical ratio-based techniques. Using fluorescent intensity and morphological and texture features, they evaluated how the performance of data analysis increases with increasing feature numbers. Their findings are based on a case study involving an siRNA screen monitoring nucleoplasmic and nucleolar accumulation of a fluorescently tagged reporter protein. For the analysis, they developed a complete analysis workflow incorporating image segmentation, feature extraction, cell classification, hit detection, and visualization of the results. For the classification task, the authors have established a new graphical framework, the Advanced Cell Classifier, which provides a very accurate high-content screen analysis with minimal user interaction, offering access to a variety of advanced machine learning methods.

AB The task of network management and monitoring relies on an accurate characterization of network traffic generated by different applications and network protocols. We employ three supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, Bayesian Networks, Decision Trees and Multilayer Perceptrons for the flow-based classification of six different types of Internet traffic including peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery (Akamai) traffic. The dependency of the traffic classification performance on the amount and composition of training data is investigated followed by experiments that show that ML algorithms such as Bayesian Networks and Decision Trees are suitable for Internet traffic flow classification at a high speed, and prove to be robust with respect to applications that dynamically change their source ports. Finally, the importance of correctly classified training instances is highlighted by an experiment that is conducted with wrongly labeled training data. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Real world data sets are often imbalanced with respect to the class distribution. Classifier design from those data sets is relatively new challenge. The main problem is the lack of positive class patterns in the data sets. To deal with this problem, there are two main approaches. One is to additionally sample minority class patterns (i.e., over-sampling). The other is to sample a part of majority class patterns (i.e., under-sampling). In our previous research, we have proposed a parallel distributed genetics-based machine learning for large data sets. In our method, not only a population but also a training data set is divided into subgroups, respectively. A pair of a sub-population and a training data subset is assigned to an individual CPU core in order to reduce the computation time. In this paper, our parallel distributed approach is applied to imbalanced data sets. The training data subsets are constructed by a composition of subsets divided majority class patterns with the entire set of non-divided minority class patterns. Through computational experiments, we show the effectiveness of our parallel distributed approach with the proposed data subdivision schemes for imbalanced data sets.

AB In this work, classification of Tuberculosis (TB) digital images has been attempted using active contour method and Differential Evolution based Extreme Learning Machines (DE-ELM). The sputum smear positive and negative images (N=100) recorded under standard image acquisition protocol are subjected to segmentation using level set formulation of active contour method. Moment features are extracted from the segmented images using Hu's and Zernike method. Further, the most significant moment features derived using Principal Component Analysis and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) are subjected to classification using DE-ELM. Results show that the segmentation method identifies the bacilli retaining their shape in-spite of artifacts present in the images. It is also observed that with the KPCA derived significant features, DE-ELM performed with higher accuracy and faster learning speed in classifying the images.

AB gamma-Secretase inhibitors have been explored for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods for prediction and screening of gamma-secretase inhibitors are highly desired for facilitating the design of novel therapeutic agents against AD, especially when incomplete knowledge about the mechanism and three-dimensional structure of gamma-secretase. We explored two machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), to develop models for predicting gamma-secretase inhibitors of diverse structures. Quantitative analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to further examine and optimize the models. Especially, the Youden index (YI) was initially introduced into the ROC curve of RF so as to obtain an optimal threshold of probability for prediction. The developed models were validated by an external testing set with the prediction accuracies of SVM and RE 96.48 and 98.83% for gamma-secretase inhibitors and 98.18 and 99.27% for noninhibitors, respectively. The different feature selection methods were used to extract the physicochemical features most relevant to gamma-secretase inhibition. To the best of our knowledge, the RF model developed in this work is the first model with a broad applicability domain, based on which the virtual screening of gamma-secretase inhibitors against the ZINC database was performed, resulting in 368 potential hit candidates.

DE Coronary centerline extraction; coronary lumen segmentation; vesselness
   measurement; machine learning
AB Automatic coronary centerline extraction and lumen segmentation facilitate the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is a leading cause of death in developed countries. Various coronary centerline extraction methods have been proposed and most of them are based on shortest path computation given one or two end points on the artery. The major variation of the shortest path based approaches is in the different vesselness measurements used for the path cost. An empirically designed measurement (e. g., the widely used Hessian vesselness) is by no means optimal in the use of image context information. In this paper, a machine learning based vesselness is proposed by exploiting the rich domain specific knowledge embedded in an expert-annotated dataset. For each voxel, we extract a set of geometric and image features. The probabilistic boosting tree (PBT) is then used to train a classifier, which assigns a high score to voxels inside the artery and a low score to those outside. The detection score can be treated as a vesselness measurement in the computation of the shortest path. Since the detection score measures the probability of a voxel to be inside the vessel lumen, it can also be used for the coronary lumen segmentation. To speed up the computation, we perform classification only for voxels around the heart surface, which is achieved by automatically segmenting the whole heart from the 3D volume in a preprocessing step. An efficient voxel-wise classification strategy is used to further improve the speed. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed learning based vesselness outperforms the conventional Hessian vesselness in both speed and accuracy. On average, it only takes approximately 2.3 seconds to process a large volume with a typical size of 512x512x200 voxels.

AB Background: Gene duplication can lead to genetic redundancy, which masks the function of mutated genes in genetic analyses. Methods to increase sensitivity in identifying genetic redundancy can improve the efficiency of reverse genetics and lend insights into the evolutionary outcomes of gene duplication. Machine learning techniques are well suited to classifying gene family members into redundant and non-redundant gene pairs in model species where sufficient genetic and genomic data is available, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, the test case used here.
   Results: Machine learning techniques that combine multiple attributes led to a dramatic improvement in predicting genetic redundancy over single trait classifiers alone, such as BLAST E-values or expression correlation. In withholding analysis, one of the methods used here, Support Vector Machines, was two-fold more precise than single attribute classifiers, reaching a level where the majority of redundant calls were correctly labeled. Using this higher confidence in identifying redundancy, machine learning predicts that about half of all genes in Arabidopsis showed the signature of predicted redundancy with at least one but typically less than three other family members. Interestingly, a large proportion of predicted redundant gene pairs were relatively old duplications (e. g., Ks > 1), suggesting that redundancy is stable over long evolutionary periods.
   Conclusions: Machine learning predicts that most genes will have a functionally redundant paralog but will exhibit redundancy with relatively few genes within a family. The predictions and gene pair attributes for Arabidopsis provide a new resource for research in genetics and genome evolution. These techniques can now be applied to other organisms.

AB This work adopts data related to the rotor efficiency of wind turbine to estimate the performance of wind turbine. To achieve this goal, two novel machine learning methods are adopted to build models for wind-turbine fault detection: one is the support vector data description (SVDD) and the other is the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). The data collected from a normally-operating wind turbine are used to train models. In addition, we also build a health index using the KPCA reconstruction error, which can be used to predict the performance of a wind turbine when it operates online. The data used in our experiments were collected from a real wind turbine in Taiwan. Experiments results show that the model based on KPCA performs better than the one based on SVDD. The highest fault detection rate for KPCA model is higher than 98%. The results also indicate the validity of using rotor efficacy to predict the overall performance of a wind turbine.

   Relative density degree
AB This paper proposes a new classifier called density-induced margin support vector machines (DMSVMs). DMSVMs belong to a family of SVM-like classifiers. Thus, DMSVMs inherit good properties from support vector machines (SVMs), e.g., unique and global solution, and sparse representation for the decision function. For a given data set, DMSVMs require to extract relative density degrees for all training data points. These density degrees can be taken as relative margins of corresponding training data points. Moreover, we propose a method for estimating relative density degrees by using the K nearest neighbor method. We also show the upper bound on the leave-out-one error of DMSVMs for a binary classification problem and prove it. Promising results are obtained on toy as well as real-world data sets.

AB Based on the theoretical foundation of hedonic methods, positive relationships between various types of environmental amenities and house sales price have been investigated. However, as hedonic theory does not provide any arguments in favor of specific sets of independent variables, this lack of theoretical support led researchers to select independent variables from empirical results and intuitive information of previous studies. In previous hedonic studies, the most widely used selection criterion was stepwise selection for multiple regression with ordinary least square (OLS) regression for model fitting. The objective of this study is to apply machine learning approaches to the hedonic variable selection and house sales price modeling. Two rule-based machine learning regression methods including Cubist and Random Forest (RF) were compared with the traditional OLS regression for hedonic modeling. Each regression method was applied to analyze 4469 house transaction data from Onondaga County, NY (USA) with two different neighborhood configurations (i.e., 100 m and 1 km radius buffers). Results showed that the RF resulted in the highest accuracy in terms of hedonic price modeling followed by Cubist and the traditional OLS method. Each regression method selected different sets of environmental variables for different neighborhood. Since the variables selected by RF method led to make an in-depth hypothesis reflecting the preferences of house buyers, RF may prove to be useful for important variable selection for the hedonic price equation as well as enhancing model performance.

AB We investigate the use of meta-heuristics and machine learning to automate reconfigurable application parameter optimization. The traditional approach involves two steps: (a) analyzing the application in order to create models and tools for exploration of the parameter space, and (b) exploring the parameter space using such tools. The proposed approach, called the Machine Learning Optimizer (MLO), involves a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with an underlying surrogate fitness function model based on Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We present a case study of a quadrature based financial application with varied precision. We evaluate our approach by comparing the amount of benchmark evaluations and bit-stream generations when using MLO and when using the traditional approach.

AB A series of carefully chosen decisions by an Emergency Responder during a disaster are vital in mitigating the loss of human lives and the recovery of critical infrastructures. In this paper we propose to assist a human Emergency Responder by modeling and simulating an intelligent agent using Reinforcement Learning. The goal of the agent will be to maximize the number of patients discharged from hospitals or on-site emergency units. It is suggested that by exposing such an intelligent agent to a large sequence of simulated disaster scenarios, the agent will capture enough experience and knowledge to enable it to select those actions which mitigate damage and casualties.
   This paper describes early results of our work that indicate that the use of Q-learning can successfully train an agent to make good choices, during a simulated disaster.

A commercial system for the analysis and summarization of legal documents provided us with a corpus of almost 4,000 text and extract pairs for our machine learning experiments. That corpus was pre-processed to identify the selected source sentences in extracts from which we generated legal structured data. We finally describe our sentence classification experiments relying on a Naive Bayes classifier using a set of surface, emphasis, and content features.

AB A novel nanotechnology laboratory experiment for a required junior/senior undergraduate engineering course, Engineering of Manufacturing Processes, is described and implemented. The experiment demonstrates a process of manufacturing carbon nanotubes using a method representing a variation on arc discharge. Carbon nanotubes are synthesized in oil by electric discharge machining using two graphite electrodes. The results are compared to a known empirical formula for material removal rate in electric discharge machining. A cost analysis of the process, determining the cost of as produced carbon nanotubes is performed. This 2-h experiment is complemented with a single 2-h lecture on nanotechnology creating a lecture-experiment nanotechnology module. Student learning outcomes for the module are developed, assessed, and analyzed. The results show a significant improvement in students' knowledge. Student perceptions about nanotechnology, carbon nano tube manufacturing, and the need for life-long learning are assessed. Pedagogical justifications and sustainability of the nanotechnology lecture-experiment module within an undergraduate engineering curriculum are addressed.

AB Importance of the field: The cost of developing new drugs is estimated at similar to $1 billion; the withdrawal of a marketed compound due to toxicity can result in serious financial loss for a pharmaceutical company. There has been a greater interest in the development of in silico tools that can identify compounds with metabolic liabilities before they are brought to market.
   Areas covered in this review: The two largest classes of machine learning (ML) models, which will be discussed in this review, have been developed to predict binding to the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) ion channel protein and the various CYP isoforms. Being able to identify potentially toxic compounds before they are made would greatly reduce the number of compound failures and the costs associated with drug development.
   What the reader will gain: This review summarizes the state of modeling hERG and CYP binding towards this goal since 2003 using ML algorithms.
   Take home message: A wide variety of ML algorithms that are comparable in their overall performance are available. These ML methods may be applied regularly in discovery projects to flag compounds with potential metabolic liabilities.

ID TEXT CATEGORIZATION
AB The most popular method for judging the impact of biomedical articles is citation count which is the number of citations received. The most significant limitation of citation count is that it cannot evaluate articles at the time of publication since citations accumulate over time. This work presents computer models that accurately predict citation counts of biomedical publications within a deep horizon of 10 years using only predictive information available at publication time. Our experiments show that it is indeed feasible to accurately predict future citation counts with a mixture of content-based and bibliometric features using machine learning methods. The models pave the way for practical prediction of the long-term impact of publication, and their statistical analysis provides greater insight into citation behavior.

ID MAP GENERALIZATION; DISPLACEMENT
AB The introduction of automated generalisation procedures in map production systems requires that generalisation systems are capable of processing large amounts of map data in acceptable time and that cartographic quality is similar to traditional map products. With respect to these requirements, we examine two complementary approaches that should improve generalisation systems currently in use by national topographic mapping agencies. Our focus is particularly on self-evaluating systems, taking as an example those systems that build on the multi-agent paradigm. The first approach aims to improve the cartographic quality by utilising cartographic expert knowledge relating to spatial context. More specifically, we introduce expert rules for the selection of generalisation operations based on a classification of buildings into five urban structure types, including inner city, urban, suburban, rural, and industrial and commercial areas. The second approach aims to utilise machine learning techniques to extract heuristics that allow us to reduce the search space and hence the time in which a good cartographical solution is reached. Both approaches are tested individually and in combination for the generalisation of buildings from map scale 1:5000 to the target map scale of 1:25000. Our experiments show improvements in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. We provide evidence that both approaches complement each other and that a combination of expert and machine learnt rules give better results than the individual approaches. Both approaches are sufficiently general to be applicable to other forms of self-evaluating, constraint-based systems than multi-agent systems, and to other feature classes than buildings. Problems have been identified resulting from difficulties to formalise cartographic quality by means of constraints for the control of the generalisation process.

ID VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; PURKINJE-CELLS; EYE-MOVEMENT; ADAPTATION
AB A cerebellum-machine interface (CMI) was developed to understand cerebellar roles in motor control and learning by testing direct causality between single unit cerebellar Purkinje cell activity and motor learning. The CMI converts Purkinje cell simple spike firing rate into pulse-width modulation signals that drive a single joint robot arm. The CMI has no adaptive capability, thus any change observed in robot arm motion can be attributed directly to Purkinje cell firing activity. We employed a vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) adaptation paradigm in goldfish as the test for motor learning. Changes in eye muscle characteristics, or equivalently adding visual motion stimulus during head rotation require oculomotor commands to be calibrated by minimizing image slip across the retina, which acts as a control error signal. This calibration, known as VOR motor learning, has been postulated to depend on synaptic plasticity in the vestibulo-cerebellum, where Purkinje cells are believed to encode motor commands for eye movement. If this is true, then vestibulo-cerebellar Purkinje cells may similarly learn to correct error in a motor command signal when the oculomotor system is replaced with a different system, such as a robot arm. Desired motion and control error signal of the robot arm were presented as head rotation and retinal slip, respectively, to the fish VOR model. The control error of the robot arm was shown to decrease gradually, but not monotonically, and in many cases only in one direction. This evidence is the first direct demonstration that activity of a single Purkinje cell is capable of implementing adaptive motor control. The results also suggest that a single Purkinje cell can be responsible, at least in part, for directional selective VOR motor learning previously reported in goldfish [6] and monkeys [3].

AB To avoid ecological collapse, we must manage Earth's ecosystems sustainably. Viewed as a control problem, the two central challenges of ecosystem management are to acquire a model of the system that is sufficient to guide good decision making and then optimize the control policy against that model. This paper describes three efforts aimed at addressing the first of these challenges-machine learning methods for modeling ecosystems. The first effort focuses on automated quality control of environmental sensor data. Next, we consider the problem of learning species distribution models from citizen science observational data. Finally, we describe a novel approach to modeling the migration of birds. A major challenge for all of these methods is to scale up to large, spatially-distributed systems.

AB According to the theory of SVMs, while traditional techniques for pattern recognition are based on the attempt to optimize the performance in terms of the empirical risk, SVMs minimize the structural risk, that is, the probability of misclassifying yet-to-be-seen patterns for a fixed but unknown probability distribution of data. The most distinguished and attractive features of this classification paradigm are the ability to condense the information contained by the training set and the use of families of decision surfaces of relatively low Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. In this paper we propose a heuristic learning algorithm of gradient type for training a SVM and analyze its performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency when applied to linear separable data. In order to evaluate the efficiency of our learning method, several tests were performed against the Platt's SMO method, and the conclusions are formulated in the final section of the paper.

AB The theory of extreme learning machines (ELMs) has recently become increasingly popular. As a new learning algorithm for single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks, an ELM offers the advantages of low computational cost, good generalization ability, and ease of implementation. Hence the comparison and model selection between ELMs and other kinds of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches has become significant and has attracted many research efforts. This paper performs a comparative analysis of the basic ELMs and support vector machines (SVMs) from two viewpoints that are different from previous works: one is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension, and the other is their performance under different training sample sizes. It is shown that the VC dimension of an ELM is equal to the number of hidden nodes of the ELM with probability one. Additionally, their generalization ability and computational complexity are exhibited with changing training sample size. ELMs have weaker generalization ability than SVMs for small sample but can generalize as well as SVMs for large sample. Remarkably, great superiority in computational speed especially for large-scale sample problems is found in ELMs. The results obtained can provide insight into the essential relationship between them, and can also serve as complementary knowledge for their past experimental and theoretical comparisons.

AB Metabolomics experiments involve the simultaneous detection of a high number of metabolites leading to large multivariate datasets and computer-based applications are required to extract relevant biological information. A high-throughput metabolic fingerprinting approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was developed for the detection of wound biomarkers in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. High-dimensional data were generated and analysed with chemometric methods.
   Besides, machine learning classification algorithms constitute promising tools to decipher complex metabolic phenotypes but their application remains however scarcely reported in that research field. The present work proposes a comparative evaluation of a set of diverse machine learning schemes in the context of metabolomic data with respect to their ability to provide a deeper insight into the metabolite network involved in the wound response. Standalone classifiers, i.e. J48 (decision tree), kNN (instance-based learner), SMO (support vector machine), multilayer perceptron and RBF network (neural networks) and Naive Bayes (probabilistic method), or combinations of classification and feature selection algorithms, such as Information Gain, RELIEF-F. Correlation Feature-based Selection and SVM-based methods, are concurrently assessed and cross-validation resampling procedures are used to avoid overfitting.
   This study demonstrates that machine learning methods represent valuable tools for the analysis of UPLC-TOF/MS metabolomic data. In addition, remarkable performance was achieved, while the models' stability showed the robustness and the interpretability potential. The results allowed drawing attention to both temporal and spatial metabolic patterns in the context of stress signalling and highlighting relevant biomarkers not evidenced with standard data treatment.

AB This chapter presents a new approach for distance relaying of transmission line using machine intelligence technique such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a relatively new computational learning method based on the statistical learning theory. The proposed technique is used for developing protection schemes for Thyristor Controlled Series Compensated (TCSC) Line using post fault current samples for half cycle (10 samples) from the inception of the fault and firing angle as inputs to the SVM. Three SVMs are trained to provide fault classification, ground detection and section identification respectively for the TCSC line. Also SVM is used for faulty phase selection and ground detection in large power transmission system without TCSC. The method uses post fault current and voltage samples for 1/4(th) cycle (5 samples) as inputs to SVM-1 to result faulty phase selection. SVM-2 is trained and tested with zero sequence components of fundamental, 3(rd) and 5(th) harmonic components of the post fault current signal to result the involvement of ground in the fault process. The polynomial and Gaussian kernel based SVMs are designed to provide most optimized boundary for classification. The classification test results from SVMs are accurate for simulation model as well as experimental set-up, and thus provides fast and robust protection scheme for distance relaying in transmission line.

AB The prediction of business failure is an important and challenging issue that has served as the impetus for many academic studies over the past three decades. This paper proposes a hybrid manifold learning approach model which combines both isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP) algorithm and support vector machines (SVM) to predict the failure of firms based on past financial performance data. By making use of the ISOMAP algorithm to perform dimension reduction, is then utilized as a preprocessor to improve business failure prediction capability by SVM. To create a benchmark, we further compare principal component analysis (PCA) and SVM with our proposed hybrid approach. Analytic results demonstrate that our hybrid approach not only has the best classification rate, but also produces the lowest incidence of Type II errors, and is capable of achieving an improved predictive accuracy and of providing guidance for decision makers to detect and prevent potential financial crises in the early stages.

AB The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is generating the most detailed map of the gamma-ray sky. While tremendously successful, approximately 25% of all associated Fermi extragalactic sources in the Second Fermi LAT Catalog (2FGL) are listed as active galactic nuclei (AGN) of uncertain type. Most of these are suspected blazar candidates without a conclusive optical spectrum or lacking spectroscopic observations. Here, we explore the use of machine-learning algorithms - Random Forests and Support Vector Machines - to predict specific AGN subclass based on observed gamma-ray properties.

AB Emerging biomedical sensors and stimulators offer unprecedented modalities for delivering therapy and acquiring physiological signals (e. g., deep brain stimulators). Exploiting these in intelligent, closed-loop systems requires detecting specific physiological states using very low power (i.e., 1-10mW for wearable devices, 10-100 mu W for implantable devices). Machine learning is a powerful tool for modeling correlations in physiological signals, but model complexity in typical biomedical applications makes detection too computationally intensive.
   We analyze the computational energy trade-offs and propose a method of restructuring the computations to yield more favorable trade-offs, especially for typical biomedical applications. We thus develop a methodology for implementing low-energy classification kernels and demonstrate energy reduction in practical biomedical systems.
   Two applications, arrhythmia detection using electrocardiographs (ECG) from the MIT-BIH database [1] and seizure detection using electroencephalographs (EEG) from the CHB-MIT [1,2] database, are used. The proposed computational restructuring can be used with very little performance degradation, and it reduces energy by 2627x and 7.0-36.3x (depending on the patient), respectively.

AB Urban sprawl driven by shifts in tourism development produces new suburban landscapes of water consumption on Mediterranean coasts. Golf courses, ornamental, 'Atlantic' gardens and swimming pools are the most striking artefacts of this transformation, threatening the local water supply systems and exacerbating water scarcity. In the face of climate change, urban landscape irrigation is becoming increasingly important from a resource management point of view. This paper adopts urban remote sensing towards a targeted mapping approach using machine learning techniques and high-resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) to generate GIS-ready information for urban water consumption studies. Swimming pools, vegetation and - as a subgroup of vegetation - turf grass are extracted as important determinants of water consumption. For image analysis, the complex nature of urban environments suggests spatial-spectral classification, i.e. the complementary use of the spectral signature and spatial descriptors. Multiscale image segmentation provides means to extract the spatial descriptors - namely object feature layers - which can be concatenated at pixel level to the spectral signature. This study assesses the value of object features using different machine learning techniques and amounts of labeled information for learning. The results indicate the benefit of the spatial-spectral approach if combined with appropriate classifiers like tree-based ensembles or support vector machines, which can handle high dimensionality. Finally, a Random Forest classifier was chosen to deliver the classified input data for the estimation of evaporative water loss and net landscape irrigation requirements.

AB This study describes two machine learning techniques applied to predict liquefaction susceptibility of soil based on the standard penetration test (SPT) data from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake. The first machine learning technique which uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on multi-layer perceptions (MLP) that are trained with Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The second machine learning technique uses the Support Vector machine (SVM) that is firmly based on the theory of statistical learning theory, uses classification technique. ANN and SVM have been developed to predict liquefaction susceptibility using corrected SPT [(N-1)(60)] and cyclic stress ratio (CSR). Further, an attempt has been made to simplify the models, requiring only the two parameters [(N-1)(60) and peck ground acceleration (a(max)/g)], for the prediction of liquefaction susceptibility. The developed ANN and SVM models have also been applied to different case histories available globally. The paper also highlights the capability of the SVM over the ANN models.

AB This paper presents the first results of the integration of a Spanish-to-LSE Machine Translation (MT) system into an e-learning platform. Most e-learning platforms provide speech-based contents, which makes them inaccessible to the Deaf. To solve this issue, we have developed a MT system that translates Spanish speech-based contents into LSE.
   To test our MT system, we have integrated it into an e-learning tool. The e-learning tool sends the audio to our platform. The platform sends back the subtitles and a video stream with the signed translation to the e-learning tool.
   Preliminary results, evaluating the sign language synthesis module, show an isolated sign recognition accuracy of 97%. The sentence recognition accuracy was of 93%.

AB This paper addresses single-machine scheduling problems under the consideration of learning effect and resource allocation in a group technology environment. In the proposed model of this paper the actual processing times of jobs depend on the job position, the group position, and the amount of resource allocated to them concurrently. Learning effect and two resource allocation functions are examined for minimizing the weighted sum of makespan and total resource cost, and the weighted sum of total completion time and total resource cost. We show that the problems for minimizing the weighted sum of makespan and total resource cost remain polynomially solvable. We also prove that the problems for minimizing the weighted sum of total completion time and total resource cost have polynomial solutions under certain conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Weather forecast data generated by the NOAA Global Forecasting System (GFS) model, climate indices, and local meteo-hydrologic observations were used to forecast daily streamflows for a small watershed in British Columbia, Canada, at lead times of 1-7 days. Three machine learning methods - Bayesian neural network (BNN), support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process (GP) - were used and compared with multiple linear regression (MLR). The nonlinear models generally outperformed MLR, and BNN tended to slightly outperform the other nonlinear models. Among various combinations of predictors, local observations plus the GFS output were generally best at shorter lead times, while local observations plus climate indices were best at longer lead times. The climate indices selected include the sea surface temperature in the Nino 3.4 region, the Pacific-North American teleconnection (PNA), the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the binary forecasts for extreme (high) streamflow events, the best predictors to use were the local observations plus GFS output. Interestingly, climate indices contribute to daily streamflow forecast scores during longer lead times of 5-7 days, but not to forecast scores for extreme streamflow events for all lead times studied (1-7 days).

AB Autonomous systems gather high-dimensional sensorimotor data with their multimodal sensors. Symbol grounding is about whether these systems can, based on this data, construct symbols that serve as a vehicle for higher symbol-oriented cognitive processes. Machine learning and data mining techniques are geared towards finding structures and input-output relations in this data by providing appropriate interface algorithms that translate raw data into symbols. Can autonomous systems learn how to ground symbols in an unsupervised way, only with a feedback on the level of higher objectives? A target-oriented optimization procedure is suggested as a solution to the symbol grounding problem. It is demonstrated that the machine learning perspective introduced in this paper is consistent with the philosophical perspective of constructivism. Interface optimization offers a generic way to ground symbols in machine learning. The optimization perspective is argued to be consistent with von Glasersfeld's view of the world as a black box. A case study illustrates technical details of the machine symbol grounding approach.

AB The identification of small potent compounds that selectively bind to the target under consideration with high affinities is a critical step toward successful drug discovery. However, there is still a lack of efficient and accurate computational methods to predict compound selectivity properties. In this paper, we propose a set of machine learning methods to do compound selectivity prediction. In particular, we propose a novel cascaded learning method and a multitask learning method. The cascaded method decomposes the selectivity prediction into two steps, one model for each step, so as to effectively filter out nonselective compounds. The multitask method incorporates both activity and selectivity models into one multitask model so as to better differentiate compound selectivity properties. We conducted a comprehensive set of experiments and compared the results with those of other conventional selectivity prediction methods, and our results demonstrated that the cascaded and multitask methods significantly improve the selectivity prediction performance.

AB Much epidemiologic information resides in literature, which is not in a computable format. To extract information and build knowledge bases of epidemiologic studies, we developed a system to extract noun phrases about epidemiologic exposures and outcomes. The system consists of two components:
   a natural language processing (NLP) engine a machine learning (ML) based classifier.
   Four ML algorithms were applied and compared over different feature sets. To evaluate the performance of the system, we manually constructed an annotated dataset. The system achieved the highest F-measure of 82.0% for extracting exposure terms, and 70% for extracting outcome terms.

AB This paper introduces a cylindricity evaluation algorithm based on support vector machine learning with a specific kernel function, referred to as SVR, as a viable alternative to traditional least square method (LSQ) and non-linear programming algorithm (NLP). Using the theory of support vector machine regression, the proposed algorithm in this paper provides more robust evaluation in terms of CPU time and accuracy than NLP and this is supported by computational experiments. Interestingly, it has been shown that the SVR significantly outperforms LSQ in terms of the accuracy while it can evaluate the cylindricity in a more robust fashion than NLP when the variance of the data points increases. The robust nature of the proposed algorithm is expected because it converts the original nonlinear problem with nonlinear constraints into other nonlinear problem with linear constraints. In addition, the proposed algorithm is programmed using Java Runtime Environment to provide users with a Web based open source environment. In a real-world setting, this would provide manufacturers with an algorithm that can be trusted to give the correct answer rather than making a good part rejected because of inaccurate computational results.

AB To detect the presence of unknown worms, we propose a technique based on computer measurements extracted from the operating system. We designed a series of experiments to test the new technique by employing several computer configurations and background application activities. In the course of the experiments, 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature-ranking measures were used to reduce the number of features required for classification. We applied support vector machines to the resulting feature subsets. In addition, we used active learning as a selective sampling method to increase the performance of the classifier and improve its robustness in the presence of misleading instances in the data. Our results indicate a mean detection accuracy in excess of 90 %, and an accuracy above 94 % for specific unknown worms using just 20 features, while maintaining a low false-positive rate when the active learning approach is applied.

AB Cancer-associated muscle wasting is associated with reduction in functional status, in response to treatment and in life expectancy. Methods currently used to assess muscle loss involve diagnostic imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), which are costly, inconvenient, invasive, time consuming and have limited ability to detect early or slowly evolving wasting. We present a novel approach using single time-point urinary metabolite profiles to determine whether a patient is experiencing muscle wasting. We analyzed 93 random urine samples from patients with cancer using H-1-NMR. Using two successive CT images we assessed their lumbar skeletal muscle area (cm(2)) to estimate the rate of muscle change (% loss or gain over time) for each patient. The average muscle change over time was -4.71%/100 days in the muscle-losing group and +3.91%/100 days in the comparator group. Bivariate statistics identified metabolites related with muscle loss, including constituents and metabolites of muscle (creatine, creatinine, 3-OH-isovalerate), amino acids (Leu, Ile, Val, Ala, Thr, Tyr, Gln, Ser) and intermediary metabolites. We also applied machine-learning techniques to identify patterns of urinary metabolites that identify which patients are likely to lose muscle mass. We evaluated the predictive performance of 8 machine-learning approaches using fivefold cross validation and permutation testing, and found that SVM provided the best generalization accuracy (82.2%). These results suggest that H-1-NMR analysis of a single random urine sample may be a fast, cheap, safe and inexpensive tool to screen and monitor muscle loss, and that useful classifiers for predicting related metabolic conditions are possible with the methodology presented.

AB We present a new system for the harmonic analysis of popular musical audio. It is focused on chord estimation, although the proposed system additionally estimates the key sequence and bass notes. It is distinct from competing approaches in two main ways. First, it makes use of a new improved chromagram representation of audio that takes the human perception of loudness into account. Furthermore, it is the first system for joint estimation of chords, keys, and bass notes that is fully based on machine learning, requiring no expert knowledge to tune the parameters. This means that it will benefit from future increases in available annotated audio files, broadening its applicability to a wider range of genres. In all of three evaluation scenarios, including a new one that allows evaluation on audio for which no complete ground truth annotation is available, the proposed system is shown to be faster, more memory efficient, and more accurate than the state-of-the-art.

AB Analysis of tongue motions as captured in dynamic ultrasound (US) images has been an important tool in speech research. Previous studies generally required semi-automatic tongue segmentations to perform data analysis. In this paper, we adopt a machine learning approach that does not require tongue segmentation. Specifically, we employ advanced normalization procedures to temporally register the US sequences using their corresponding audio files. To explicitly encode motion, we then register the image frames spatio-temporally to compute a set of deformation fields from which we construct the velocity-based and spatio-temporal gestural descriptors, where the latter explicitly encode tongue dynamics during speech. Next, making use of the recently proposed Histogram Intersection Kernel, we perform support vector machine classification to evaluate the extracted descriptors with a set of clinical measures. We applied our method to speech abnormality and tongue gestures prediction. Overall, differentiating tongue motion, as produced by patients with or without speech impediments on a dataset of 24 US sequences, was achieved with classification accuracy of 94%. When applied to another dataset of 90 US sequences for two other classification tasks, accuracies were 86% and 84%.

TI MACHINE LEARNING FOR ACOUSTIC MODEL TRAINING IN AUTOMATIC SPEECH
   RECOGNITION
SO MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB A precondition for building natural human-centered man-machine interfaces is automatic speech recognition with a sufficient accuracy even in adverse conditions. An important direction for improving speech recognition performance are advanced training algorithms for the acoustic model, which captures the acoustic realization of speech in various conditions. The standard learning algorithm for speech recognizers based on Hidden Markov Models, namely maximum likelihood training, is not directly related to the decoding criterion and hence may be sub-optimal in various real-life decoding tasks. In this article, we apply two machine learning techniques to the acoustic model training in automatic speech recognition: boosting and discriminative training. We focus in particular on a boosting algorithm ("AdaBoost.M2") applied at the utterance level and a discriminative training variant called "rival training". For these algorithms, we provide experimental results on a variety of decoding tasks, demonstrating that boosting and discriminative training significantly improve recognition performance compared to standard maximum likelihood training. Furthermore, in an isolated word decoding task (proper name recognition), results for "high resolution" acoustic models show that boosting combined with discriminative training can outperform discriminative training alone, even when comparing final classifiers with a similar number of parameters. In our experiments this also holds when evaluating in decoding conditions with lexical and acoustic mismatch to the training conditions. Extending our boosting algorithm to continuous speech recognition with a single pass decoding framework, we present evaluation results on two large vocabulary spontaneous speech decoding tasks.

AB Despite its centrality to urban politics, economies and life, learning remains a neglected and undertheorised domain in urban geography. In this paper, I address this by exploring a politics of learning through two key sites: tactical learning and urban learning forums. I offer a conception of learning based on three processes: translation, or the relational distributions through which learning is produced as a sociomaterial epistemology of displacement and change; coordination, or the construction of functional systems that enable learning as a means of linking different forms of knowledge, coping with complexity and facilitating adaptation; and dwelling, or the education of attention through which learning operates as a way of seeing and inhabiting the world. I then consider this conception of learning in relation to tactical learning, i.e. the resources marginal groups use to cope with, negotiate and resist in the city, and urban learning forums, i.e. the possibilities for progressive forms of learning between different constituencies in the city. I conclude with an outline of a critical urbanism of learning.

TI MACHINE LEARNING FOR KNOWLEDGE DERIVED FROM THE PAUCITY OF DATA
SO MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH PROGRESS
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
ID FUZZIFICATION; TECHNOLOGY; SYSTEM
AB Facing the modern world of rapid change and vigorous technological development, decisions often have to be made about the paucity of data. Early in the process of developing a new system, on hand data is usually scarce and limited for deriving knowledge. In small data sets, often there is not enough data to accurately identify their characteristics and attributes, such as data distribution, mean, and variance. Hence, small data set learning becomes an important topic in machine learning. Some studies have been done to increase the predictability and accuracy of results using small samples. Although traditional statistics is a kind of method for this topic, the data attributes have to be known beforehand. The concept of adding virtual samples into a system has been used in many studies to increase data size and prediction accuracy. One of these studies, the Mega-fuzzification method, offers a carry out process for real data in small data set learning. It fuzzifies and continualizes crisp data into continuous type and expands data domains to create artificial samples to fill the data gap successfully. The increased level of the predictability and accuracy in small data set learning is dependant upon the data on hand. The accuracy increases when data size increases. When data size is large enough, the small data set learning method is barely needed. The Mega-fuzzification method has been applied in Flexible Manufacturing Systems, economic forecasts, and electric equipment output value assessment. It indeed increases the accuracy of prediction.

AB Gene transcription is one of the main biological processes that govern an organism's response to external stimuli. Understanding the mechanism of gene regulation offers an avenue with which to model this response. It has been hypothesized that one of the primary mechanisms for gene regulation is via transcription factor binding in which a protein (transcription factor) binds to certain sequences in the genome. Computationally, researchers hope to identify both the promoter region as well as the sequence motifs which are bound by transcription factors via analysis of genomic sequences. Machine learning methods make the hypothesis that these sequences are drawn from some underlying but unknown patterns of base-pairs, and are attractive due to their ability to process the large amounts of sequence and experimental data present. The ability to isolate these sequences is predicated upon the large amount of binding and expression data from experimental protocols such as Chip-Chip, SELEX, microarray, and GRIP. We review the basic background of promoter structure and then focus on three popular aspects of promoter studies: promoter prediction, promoter analysis, and promoter modeling. The chapter will cover widely used computation techniques such as Gibbs sampling, MEME, phylogenetic foot-printing, and position weight matrices in promoter analysis, motif alignment and promoter modules in promoter modeling. Finally, this chapter will describe the use of these algorithms in an integrative sense to isolate regulatory modules to rationalize the results of experimental data.

DE Example-based machine translation; Translation template ranking
ID TEMPLATES
AB Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) is a corpus based approach to Machine Translation (MT), that utilizes the translation by analogy concept. In our EBMT system, translation templates are extracted automatically from bilingual aligned corpora by substituting the similarities and differences in pairs of translation examples with variables. In the earlier versions of the discussed system, the translation results were solely ranked using confidence factors of the translation templates. In this study, we introduce an improved ranking mechanism that dynamically learns from user feedback. When a user, such as a professional human translator, submits his evaluation of the generated translation results, the system learns "context-dependent co-occurrence rules" from this feedback. The newly learned rules are later consulted, while ranking the results of the subsequent translations. Through successive translation-evaluation cycles, we expect that the output of the ranking mechanism complies better with user expectations, listing the more preferred results in higher ranks. We also present the evaluation of our ranking method which uses the precision values at top results and the BLEU metric.

AB Paraphrases are different ways of expressing the same content. Two sentences are said to be paraphrases if they are semantically equivalent. Identification of paraphrases has numerous applications such as Information Extraction, Question Answering, etc. The traditional systems use threshold values to decide whether two sentences are paraphrases. This threshold determination process is independent on the training data and apart may lead to incorrect paraphrase reasoning. In order to avoid the threshold settings, we propose to use machine learning techniques. The advantages of a ML approach is its ability to account for a large mass of information and the possibility to incorporate different information sources like morphologic, syntactic, and semantic among others in a single execution. With the objective to increase the performance of the system and to develop a machine learning approach for paraphrase identification, we scrutinize the influence of the combination of lexical and semantic information, as well as techniques for classifier combination

TI An Efficient Learning Procedure for Deep Boltzmann Machines
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB We present a new learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines that contain many layers of hidden variables. Data-dependent statistics are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and data-independent statistics are estimated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of statistic that enter into the gradient of the log likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer pretraining phase that initializes the weights sensibly. The pretraining also allows the variational inference to be initialized sensibly with a single bottom-up pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB data sets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn very good generative models of handwritten digits and 3D objects. We also show that the features discovered by deep Boltzmann machines are a very effective way to initialize the hidden layers of feedforward neural nets, which are then discriminatively fine-tuned.

AB Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the standard tools for machine learning. Based on the statistical learning theory and optimization theory. But, SVM, which still has some limitations, Support vector machine is the algorithm to solve two classification problems, and for multi-class classification problems, there are many work to need further research. Especially Support vector machines is very sensitive to noises and outliers, how to reduce the effect of nises and outliers needs to be further explored.
   Support Vector Machine (SVM) is sensitive to noises and outliers. For reducing the effect of noises and outliers, we propose a novel SVM based on reducing noises and outliers. We propose a new objective function and control the size of error function. The importance and error of samples are considered. By solving the dual problem of SVM, the separation hypersurface is simplified and the margin of hypersurface is widened. The numbers of support vector and running times are decreased. Experimental results show that our proposed method is able to simultaneously increase the classification efficiency and the generalization ability of the SVM.

AB It is advocated that the success and user acceptability of Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs) will predominantly depend on their electrical energy consumption rate and the corresponding degree of autonomy that they offer. FEVs must provide their drivers with the highest possible autonomy, as well as with a high degree of reliability and robustness in terms of energy performance. Thus, appropriate innovative ICT solutions must be adopted, in order to assist the driver in dealing with such energy-related issues, and strengthen FEVs' autonomy and reliability. Such an ICT solution tailored for FEVs is the focus of this paper. In detail, this paper presents a novel implementation of energy-efficient routing based on machine learning engines. It identifies and explains appropriate instance and target attributes, related to road segments and vehicles characteristics. Consequently, it proposes a robust machine learning model, capable of predicting the actual energy that is expected to be consumed by the vehicle on the particular road segment. Scalability aspects are, then, discussed and presented Finally, useful conclusions on the performance of the proposed model are reached. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Based on L-2 Support Vector Machines(SVMs), Vapnik and Vashist introduced the concept of Learning Using Privileged Information(LUPI). This new paradigm takes into account the elements of human teaching during the process of machine learning. However, with the utilization of privileged information, the extended L-2 SVM model given by Vapnik and Vashist doubles the number of parameters used in the standard L-2 SVM. Lots of computing time would be spent on tuning parameters. In order to reduce this workload, we proposed using L-1 SVM instead of L-2 SVM for LUPI in our previous work. Different from LUPI with L-2 SVM, which is formulated as quadratic programming, LUPI with L-1 SVM is essentially a linear programming and is computationally much cheaper. On this basis, we discuss how to employ the wisdom from teachers better and more flexible by LUPI with L-1 SVM in this paper. By introducing kernels, an extended L-1 SVM model, which is still a linear programming, is proposed. With the help of nonlinear kernels, the new model allows the privileged information be explored in a transformed feature space instead of the original data domain. Numerical experiment is carried out on both time series prediction and digit recognition problems. Experimental results also validate the effectiveness of our new method.

AB In heterogeneous, multisensor and multitarget data fusion systems the notion of "levels" is used in order to divide the complex problem of discovering relationships between objects into parts which are easier to understand. In presented paper we consider classifiers as general feature generators, these algorithms are able to connect data from different sensors and different observations. The classifier increases the level of data abstraction, which simplifies the architecture of following system components in data fusion chain.
   A data fusion engine named DAFNE uses the presented paradigm in its classifier module. The module was implemented in Python and C++, the Naive Bayesian and decision tree classifiers were used. The tests on simulated data shows improvement of data quality via fusion. The system design allowed to attain real-time processing with limited data volume.

AB In this paper, an automatic system is presented for target recognition using target echo signals of High Resolution Range (HRR) radars. This paper especially deals with combination of the feature extraction and classification from measured real target echo signal waveforms by using X-band pulse radar. The past studies in the field of radar target recognition have shown that the learning speed of feedforward neural networks is in general much slower than required and it has been a major disadvantage. There are two key reasons forth is status of feedforward neural networks: (1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and (2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms (Feng, Huang, Lin, & Gay, 2009; Huang & Siew, 2004, 2005; Huang & Chen, 2007, 2008; Huang, Chen, & Slew, 2006; Huang, Ding, & Zhou, 2010; Huang, Zhu, & Slew, 2004; Huang, Liang, Rong, Saratchandran, & Sundararajan, 2005; Huang, Zhou, Ding, & Zhang, in press; Huang, Li, Chen, & Siew, 2008; Huang, Wang, & Lan, 2011; Huang et al., 2006; Huang, Zhu, & Siew, 2006a, 20066; Lan, Soh, & Huang, 2009; Li, Huang, Saratchandran, & Sundararajan, 2005; Liang, Huang, Saratchandran, & Sundararajan, 2006; Liang, Saratchandran, Huang, & Sundararajan, 2006; Rong, Huang, Saratchandran, & Sundararajan, 2009; Wang & Huang, 2005; Wang, Cao, & Yuan, 2011; Yeu, Lim, Huang, Agarwal, & Ong, 2006; Zhang, Huang, Sundararajan, & Saratchandran, 2007; Zhu, Qin, Suganthan, & Huang, 2005). To resolve these disadvantages of feedforward neural networks for automatic target recognition area in this paper suggested a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) (Feng, Huang, Lin, & Gay, 2009; Huang & Siew, 2004, 2005; Huang & Chen, 2007, 2008; Huang, Chen, & Slew, 2006; Huang, Ding, & Zhou, 2010; Huang, Zhu, & Siew, 2004: Huang, Liang, Rong, Saratchandran, & Sundararajan, 2005; Huang, Zhou, Ding, & Zhang, in press; Huang, Li, Chen, & Slew, 2008; Huang, Wang, & Lan, 2011; Huang et al., 2006; Huang, Zhu, & Siew, 2006a, 2006b; Lan, Soh, & Huang, 2009; Li, Huang, Saratchandran, & Sundararajan, 2005; Liang, Huang, Saratchandran, & Sundararajan, 2006; Liang, Saratchandran, Huang, & Sundararajan, 2006; Rong, Huang, Saratchandran, & Sundararajan, 2009; Wang & Huang, 2005; Wang, Cao, & Yuan, 2011; Yeu, Lim, Huang, Agarwal, & Ong, 2006; Zhang, Huang, Sundararajan, & Saratchandran, 2007; Zhu, Qin, Suganthan, & Huang, 2005) which randomly choose hidden nodes and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide good generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. Moreover, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and wavelet entropy is used for adaptive feature extraction in the time-frequency domain in feature extraction stage to strengthen the premium features of the ELM in this study. The correct recognition performance of this new system is compared with feedforward neural networks. The experimental results show that the new algorithm can produce good generalization performance in most cases and can learn thousands of times faster than conventional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.

AB There is growing evidence for multiple complementary learning systems in the human brain. The midbrain dopamine system, along with its projections to the striatum and throughout cortex, can be seen as implementing a form of reinforcement learning. The prefrontal cortex, supported by loops through the thalamus, provides critical mechanisms for working memory, actively maintaining task relevant control information. The hippocampus, and parahippocampal cortical areas, provide support for the persistent retention of rapidly acquired information, such as memories of life episodes. Forming the foundation of all three of these systems are fundamental processes of synaptic plasticity. These complementary learning systems continuously interact, producing learning performance that transcends the capabilities of any one mechanism. Taking inspiration from this neural architecture, I present a multicomponent learning mechanism for software agents that learns from sparse rewards but may also benefit from situated instruction. This learning process is demonstrated in a simple maze learning task.

AB This article presents a hybrid modeling framework for estimating and predicting arterial traffic conditions using streaming GPS probe data. The model is based on a well-established theory of traffic flow through signalized intersections and is combined with a machine learning framework to both learn static parameters of the roadways (such as free flow velocity or traffic signal parameters) as well as to estimate and predict travel times through the arterial network. The machine learning component of the approach uses the significant amount of historical data collected by the Mobile Millennium system since March 2009 with over 500 probe vehicles reporting their position once per minute in San Francisco, CA.
   The hybrid model provides a distinct advantage over pure statistical or pure traffic theory models in that it is robust to noisy data (due to the large volumes of historical data) and it produces forecasts using traffic flow theory principles consistent with the physics of traffic. Validation of the model is performed in two different ways. First, a large scale test of the model is performed by splitting the data source into two sets, using the first to produce the estimates and the second to validate them. Second, an alternate validation approach is presented. It consists of a 3-day experiment in which GPS data was collected once per second from 20 drivers on four routes through San Francisco, allowing for precise calculation of actual travel times. The model is run by down-sampling the data and validated using the travel times from these 20 drivers. The results indicate that this approach is a significant step forward in estimating traffic states throughout the arterial network using a relatively small amount of real-time data. The estimates from our model are compared to those given by a data-driven baseline algorithm, for which we achieve a 16% improvement in terms of the root mean squared error of travel time estimates. The primary reason for success is the reliance on a flow model of traffic, which ensures that estimates are consistent with the physics of traffic. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The relevance vector machine (RVM) is a Bayesian framework for learning sparse regression models and classifiers. Despite of its popularity and practical success, no thorough analysis of its functionality exists. In this paper we consider the RVM in the case of regression models and present two kinds of analysis results: we derive a full characterization of the behavior of the RVM analytically when the columns of the regression matrix are orthogonal and give some results concerning scale and rotation invariance of the RVM. We also consider the practical implications of our results and present a scenario in which our results can be used to detect potential weakness in the RVM framework.

AB For classification problems, the generalized eigen-value proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM) and twin support vector machine (TWSVM) are regarded as milestones in the development of the powerful SVMs, as they use the nonparallel hyperplane classifiers. In this brief, we propose an improved version, named twin bounded support vector machines (TBSVM), based on TWSVM. The significant advantage of our TBSVM over TWSVM is that the structural risk minimization principle is implemented by introducing the regularization term. This embodies the marrow of statistical learning theory, so this modification can improve the performance of classification. In addition, the successive overrelaxation technique is used to solve the optimization problems to speed up the training procedure. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in both computation time and classification accuracy, and therefore confirm the above conclusion further.

Hence, its automatic identification by image processing and machine learning techniques may lead to reliable and efficient assessments on the materials. In this paper, we introduce four widely used supervised pattern recognition techniques to accomplish metallic precipitates segmentation in scanning electron microscope images from dissimilar welding on a Hastelloy C-276 alloy: Support Vector Machines, Optimum-Path Forest, Self Organizing Maps and a Bayesian classifier. Experimental results demonstrated that all classifiers achieved similar recognition rates with good results validated by an expert in metallographic image analysis.

AB We study a bicriteria single machine scheduling problem with job-dependent and past-sequence-dependent (psd) setup time and job-dependent learning effects. The goal is to find the optimal sequence that minimizes a linear combination of a pair of performance criteria consisting of the makespan, the total completion time, and the total absolute differences in completion times. We show that special cases of the resulting three problems are solvable polynomially. However, the general cases cannot be solved in polynomial time; thus, branch- and-bound (B&B) methods are proposed to derive optimal sequences. Computational results demonstrate that the B&B methods solve relatively large problem instances in reasonable amounts of time.

AB This paper presents a particular problem dealing with the apparition of burr during the drilling process in the aeronautic industry. This burr cannot exceed a height limit of 127 mu m as set out by the aeronautical guidelines and must be eliminated before riveting. If this is not performed, it can cause structural damage which would constitute a danger due to the lack of safety. Moreover, the industry needs to find an automated and optimised process in which the drilling and deburring can be carried out in real time, eliminating those other unnecessary tasks, in order to obtain high-quality pieces. The work presents the applicability of data mining and machine learning techniques so as to obtain a real time burr detection model. This model could be implanted in the computer numerical control of the machine allowing the whole process to be automated and optimised. These techniques can be applied to other types of processes.

AB One of the major research directions in bioinformatics is that of assigning superfamily classification to a given set of proteins. The classification reflects the structural, evolutionary, and functional relatedness. These relationships are embodied in a hierarchical classification, such as the Structural Classification of Protein (SCOP), which is mostly manually curated. Such a classification is essential for the structural and functional analyses of proteins. Yet a large number of proteins remain unclassified. In this study, we have proposed an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify and assign a given set of proteins to SCOP superfamilies. In the method, we have constructed a database and similarity matrix using P-values obtained from an all-against-all BLAST run and trained the network with the ART2 unsupervised learning algorithm using the rows of the similarity matrix as input vectors, enabling the trained network to classify the proteins from 0.82 to 0.97 f-measure accuracy. The performance of ART2 has been compared with that of spectral clustering, Random forest, SVM, and HHpred. ART2 performs better than the others except HHpred. HHpred performs better than ART2 and the sum of errors is smaller than that of the other methods evaluated.

AB In this paper, we consider the scheduling problems with exponential learning effect. By the exponential learning effect, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by an exponent function of the sum of the normal processing times of the already processed jobs. We consider the following objective functions: the makespan, the total completion time, the sum of the quadratic job completion times, the total weighted completion time and the maximum lateness. For some special single machine problems and flow shop problems, we show that the problems can be solved in polynomial time.

AB Purpose: The goal of this study is to investigate the advantages of large scale optimization methods vs conventional classification techniques in predicting acute toxicity for urinary bladder and rectum due to prostate irradiation.
   Methods: Clinical and dosimetric data of 321 patients undergoing prostate conformal radiotherapy were recorded. Gastro-intestinal and genito-urinary acute toxicities were scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scale. Patients were classified in two categories to separate mild (Grade < 2) from severe toxicity levels (Grade > 2). Machine learning methods at different complexity were implemented to predict toxicity as a function of multiple variables. The first approach consisted of a large scale optimization method, based on genetic algorithms (GAs) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The second approach was a binary classifier based on support vector machines (SVM).
   Results: The ANN and SVM-based solutions showed comparable prediction accuracy, exhibiting an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.7. Different sensitivity and specificity features were measured for the two approaches. The ANN algorithm showed enhanced sensitivity if combined with appropriate classification criteria.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that high sensitivity in toxicity prediction can be achieved with optimized ANNs, that are put forward to represent a valuable support in medical decisions. Future studies will be focused on enlarging the available patient database to increase the reliability of toxicity prediction algorithms and to define optimal classification criteria.

AB Recently, sparse approximation has become a preferred method for learning large scale kernel machines. This technique attempts to represent the solution with only a subset of original data points also known as basis vectors, which are usually chosen one by one with a forward selection procedure based on some selection criteria. The computational complexity of several resultant algorithms scales as O(N M-2) in time and O(N M) in memory, where is the number of training points and is the number of basis vectors as well as the steps of forward selection. For some large scale data sets, to obtain a better solution, we are sometimes required to include more basis vectors, which means that is not trivial in this situation. However, the limited computational resource (e.g., memory) prevents us from including too many vectors. To handle this dilemma, we propose to add an ensemble of basis vectors instead of only one at each forward step. The proposed method, closely related to gradient boosting, could decrease the required number of forward steps significantly and thus a large fraction of computational cost is saved. Numerical experiments on three large scale regression tasks and a classification problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Ensuring the security of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is vital for monitoring real-time systems. One of the major security flaws experienced by WSNs is denial of service (DoS) which can even lead to the breakdown of the complete system or to wrong decisions being made by the system that can cause adverse results. This research work focuses on two techniques for detecting a DoS attack at a medium access control (MAC) layer. Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.

AB Protein-DNA interactions play an essential role in transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and many vital biological processes. The mechanism of protein-DNA binding, however, remains unclear. For the study of many diseases, researchers must improve their understanding of the amino acid motifs that recognize DNA. Because identifying these motifs experimentally is expensive and time-consuming, it is necessary to devise an approach for computational prediction. Some in silico methods have been developed, but there are still considerable limitations. In this study, we used a machine learning approach to develop a new sequence-based method of predicting protein-DNA binding residues. To make these predictions, we used the properties of the micro-environment of each amino acid from the AAIndex as well as conservation scores. Testing by the cross-validation method, we obtained an overall accuracy of 94.89%. Our method shows that the amino acid micro-environment is important for DNA binding, and that it is possible to identify the protein-DNA binding sites with it.

AB This paper proposes a new approach based on combined Wavelet Transform-Extreme Learning Machine (WT-ELM) technique for fault section identification (whether the fault is before or after the series capacitor as observed from the relay point), classification and location in a series compensated transmission line. This method uses the samples of fault currents for half cycle duration from the inception of fault. The features of fault currents are extracted by first level decomposition of the current samples using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the extracted features are applied as inputs to ELMs for fault section identification, classification and location. The feasibility of the proposed method has been tested on a 400 kV, 300 km series compensated transmission line for all the ten types of faults using MATLAB simulink. On testing 28,800 fault cases with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, load angle, percentage compensation level and source impedance, the performance of the proposed method has been found to be quite promising. The results also indicate that the proposed method is robust to wide variation in system and operating conditions. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we attempt to address the architectural design of ELM regressor by applying a constructive method on the basis of ELM algorithm. After the nonlinearities of ELM network are fixed by randomly generating the parameters, the network will correspond to a linear regression model. The selection of hidden nodes can then be regarded as a subset model selection in linear regression. The proposed constructive hidden nodes selection for ELM (referred to as CS-ELM) selects the optimal number of hidden nodes when the unbiased risk estimation based criterion C-p reaches the minimum value. A comparison of the proposed CS-ELM with other model selection algorithms of ELM is evaluated on several real benchmark regression applications. And the empirical study shows that CS-ELM leads to a compact network structure automatically. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION; BEHAVIOR
AB Mobile devices have evolved and experienced an immense popularity over the last few years. This growth however has exposed mobile devices to an increasing number of security threats. Despite the variety of peripheral protection mechanisms described in the literature, authentication and access control cannot provide integral protection against intrusions. Thus, a need for more intelligent and sophisticated security controls such as intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is necessary. Whilst much work has been devoted to mobile device IDSs, research on anomaly-based or behaviour-based IDS for such devices has been limited leaving several problems unsolved. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we focus on anomaly-based IDS for modern mobile devices. A dataset consisting of iPhone users data logs has been created, and various classification and validation methods have been evaluated to assess their effectiveness in detecting misuses. Specifically, the experimental procedure includes and cross-evaluates four machine learning algorithms (i.e. Bayesian networks, radial basis function, K-nearest neighbours and random Forest), which classify the behaviour of the end-user in terms of telephone calls, SMS and Web browsing history. In order to detect illegitimate use of service by a potential malware or a thief, the experimental procedure examines the aforementioned services independently as well as in combination in a multimodal fashion. The results are very promising showing the ability of at least one classifier to detect intrusions with a high true positive rate of 99.8%. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB We present a machine learning approach to the problem of RF specification test compaction. The proposed compaction flow relies on a multi-objective genetic algorithm, which searches in the power-set of specification tests to select appropriate subsets, and a classifier, which makes pass/fail decisions based solely on these subsets. The method is demonstrated on production test data from an RF device fabricated by IBM. The results indicate that machine learning can identify intricate correlations between specification tests, which allows us to infer the outcome of all tests from a subset of tests. Thereby, the number of tests that need to be explicitly carried out and the corresponding cost are reduced significantly without adversely impacting test accuracy.

Our algorithms can be extended to some kernelized versions of these problems, such as SVDD, hard margin SVM, and L-2-SVM, for which sublinear-time algorithms were not known before. These new algorithms use a combination of a novel sampling techniques and a new multiplicative update algorithm. We give lower bounds which show the running times of many of our algorithms to be nearly best possible in the unit-cost RAM model.

AB MapReduce is emerging as a generic parallel programming paradigm for large clusters of machines. This trend combined with the growing need to run machine learning (ML) algorithms on massive datasets has led to an increased interest in implementing ML algorithms on MapReduce. However, the cost of implementing a large class of ML algorithms as low-level MapReduce jobs on varying data and machine cluster sizes can be prohibitive. In this paper, we propose SystemML in which ML algorithms are expressed in a higher-level language and are compiled and executed in a MapReduce environment. This higher-level language exposes several constructs including linear algebra primitives that constitute key building blocks for a broad class of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. The algorithms expressed in SystemML are compiled and optimized into a set of MapReduce jobs that can run on a cluster of machines. We describe and empirically evaluate a number of optimization strategies for efficiently executing these algorithms on Hadoop, an open-source MapReduce implementation. We report an extensive performance evaluation on three ML algorithms on varying data and cluster sizes.

AB Machine learning is used in many applications, from machine vision to speech recognition to decision support systems, and it is used to test applications. However, though much has been done to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms, little has been done to verify the algorithms or examine their failure modes. Moreover, complex learning frameworks often require stepping beyond black box evaluation to distinguish between errors based on natural limits on learning and errors that arise from mistakes in implementation. We present a conceptual architecture, failure model and taxonomy, and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) of a semi-supervised, multi-modal learning system, and provide specific examples from its use in a radiological analysis assistant system. The goal of the research described in this paper is to provide a foundation from which dependability analysis of systems using semi-supervised, multi-modal learning can be conducted. The methods presented provide a first step towards that overall goal.

AB Intelligent and efficient mathematical and computational tools are needed to analyze and interpret the information content buried in large scale gene expression patterns made available by the recent development of microarray technology [28, 27]. Modern machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or matrix decomposition techniques, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), provide new and efficient analysis tools which are currently explored in this area [76].
   In this study we focus on classification tasks and apply knowledge-based as well as data-driven approaches to various microarray data sets. The data sets considered comprise the gene expression levels of either human breast cancer (HBC) cell lines or the famous leukemia data set or human peripheral blood cells differentiating from monocytes to macrophages under various environmental conditions. We study gene selection procedures either in gene space or in feature space and show that these tools are able to extract marker genes from these gene expression profiles without the need for extensive data bank search for appropriate functional annotations. With these marker genes corresponding test data sets can then easily be classified into related diagnostic categories.

AB .n this paper, for a class of switched stochastic nonlinear systems with time-varying delays, the output feedback stabilization problem is addressed based on single hidden layer feed-forward network (SLFN) and backstepping technique. Furthermore, an adaptive backstepping neural switching control scheme is presented for the above problem. In the scheme, only a SLFN is employed to compensate for all known system nonlinear terms depending on the delayed output. The output weights and control laws are updated based on the Lyapunov synthesis approach and backstepping technique to guarantee the stability of the overall system. Then a special switching law is given based on attenuation speed of each subsystem. Different from the existing techniques, the parameters of the SLFN are adjusted based on a new neural networks learning algorithm named as extreme learning machine (ELM), where all the hidden node parameters randomly be generated. Finally, the proposed control scheme is applied to an example and the simulation results demonstrate good performance.

AB Despite superior generalization performance Support vector machines (SVMs) generate black bar models. The process of converting such opaque models into transparent model is often regarded as rule extraction. This paper presents a new approach for rule extraction from SVMs using modified active learning based approach (mALBA), to predict churn in bank credit cards. The dataset is obtained from Business Intelligence Cup 2004, which is highly unbalanced with 93% loyal and 7% churned customers' data. Since identifying churner is paramount from business perspective, therefore considering sensitivity alone, the empirical results suggest that the proposed rule extraction approach using mALBA yielded the best sensitivity compared to other classifiers.

AB Multiagent-based simulation is an approach, to realize stochastic simulation where both the behavior of the modeled multiagent system and dynamic aspects of its environment are implemented with autonomous agents. Such simulation provides an ideal environment for intelligent agents to learn to perform their tasks before being deployed in a real-world environment. The presented research investigates theoretical and practical aspects of learning by autonomous agents within stochastic agent-based simulation. The theoretical work is based on the Inferential Theory of Learning, which describes learning processes from the perspective of a learner's goal as a search through knowledge space. The theory is extended for approximate and probabilistic learning to account for the situations encountered when learning in stochastic environments. Practical aspects are exemplified by two use cases in autonomous logistics: learning predictive models for environment conditions in the future, and learning in the context of evolutionary plan optimization.

ID EEG
AB Lighting in modern-day devices is often discrete. The sharp onsets and offsets of light are known to induce a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) at low frequencies. However, it is not well-known how the brain processes visual flicker at the threshold of conscious perception and beyond. To shed more light on this, we ran an EEG study in which we asked participants (N=6) to discriminate on a behavioral level between visual stimuli in which they perceived flicker and those that they perceived as constant wave light. We found that high frequency flicker which is not perceived consciously anymore still elicits a neural response in the corresponding frequency band of EEG, contralateral to the stimulated hemifield. The main contribution of this paper is to show the benefit of machine learning techniques for investigating this effect of subconscious processing: Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filtering in combination with classification based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) could be used to reveal the effect for additional participants and stimuli, with high statistical significance. We conclude that machine learning techniques are a valuable extension of conventional neurophysiological analysis that can substantially boost the sensitivity to subconscious effects, such as the processing of imperceptible flicker.

AB We consider a two-machine flow shop scheduling problem with effects of deterioration and learning. By the effects of deterioration and learning, we mean that the processing time of a job is a function of its execution starting time and its position in a sequence. The objective is to find a sequence that minimizes the makespan. Several dominance properties and two lower bounds are derived, which are used to speed up the elimination process of a branch-and-bound algorithm proposed to solve the problem. Two heuristic algorithms are also proposed to obtain near-optimal solutions. Computational results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely used in modeling of various systems. Training of ANNs is commonly performed by backpropagation based on a gradient-based learning rule. However, it is well-known that such learning rule has several shortcomings such as slow convergence and training failures. This paper proposes a modeling technique based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) eliminating disadvantages of backpropagation based on a gradient-based learning rule for the drying of bittim (pistacia terebinthus). The samples for ELM based model are obtained by experimental studies. In experimental studies, the sample mass loss rate as a function time was investigated in different air velocities (0.5 and 1 m/s) and air temperatures (40, 60 and 80 C) in a designed dryer system. The obtained samples from experiments are used for training and testing of ELM. Further, some parameters of ELM such as type of activation function and the number of hidden neurons are set to obtain the best possible modelling results. The obtained prediction results show that ELM algorithm with tangent sigmoid activation function and 20 hidden neurons is appeared to be most optimal topology since maximum R2 and minimum rms (0.0500) and cov (0.2256) values are obtained. Thus, it is concluded that ELM can be used as an effective modelling tool in the drying of bittim (pistacia terebinthus) in fixed bed dryer system.

AB Function approximators have been extensively used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to deal with large or continuous space problems. However, batch learning Neural Networks (NN), one of the most common approximators, has been rarely applied to RL. In this paper, possible reasons for this are laid out and a solution is proposed. Specifically, a Receding Horizon Cache (RHC) structure is designed to collect training data for NN by dynamically archiving state-action pairs and actively updating their Q-values, which makes batch learning NN much easier to implement. Together with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a new RL with function approximation algorithm termed as RHC and ELM based RL (RHC-ELM-RL) is proposed. A mountain car task was carried out to test RHC-ELM-RL and compare its performance with other algorithms.

AB In this work we aim to learn a Mahalanobis distance to improve the performance of phoneme classification using the standard 39-dimensional MFCC features. To learn and to evaluate the performance of our distance, we use the simple k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) classifier. Although this classifier exhibits low performance relative to state-of-the-art phoneme classifiers, it can be used to determine a distance metric that is applicable to many other better-performing machine learning methods. We devise a novel optimization method that minimizes the error function of the k-NN classifier with respect to the covariance matrix of the Mahalanobis distance, based on finite-difference stochastic approximation (FDSA) gradient estimates combined with a random perturbation term to avoid local minima. We apply our method to the problem of phoneme classification with the k-NN classifier and show that our learned distance provides performance improvement of up to 8.19% over the standard k-NN classifier, and additionally outperforms other state-of-the-art distance learning methods by approximately 4 percentage points. We also find that the computational complexity of our method, while not optimal, is better than other distance learning methods. The performance improvements for individual phoneme classes are given. The distances learned are applicable to other scale-variant machine learning methods, such as support vector machines, multidimensional scaling, and maximum variance unfolding, as well as others.

AB The implications of replicated symmetries have been far-reaching and pervasive. Given the current status of low-energy methodologies, end-users clearly desire the exploration of congestion control. In order to answer this challenge, we concentrate our efforts on disconfirming that the famous pervasive algorithm for the deployment of thin clients by Bose et al. runs in Omega(n!) time.

AB The prediction of receptor-ligand pairs is an active area of biomedical and computational research. Oddly, the application of machine learning techniques to this problem is a relatively under-exploited approach. Here we seek to understand how the application of least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) to this problem can improve receptor-ligand predictions. Over the past decade, the amount of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data available has exploded into a plethora of various databases derived from various wet-lab techniques. Here we use PPI data to predict receptor ligand pairings using LS-SVM. Our results suggest that this approach provides a meaningful prioritization of the receptor-ligand pairs.

AB We propose a novel graph-based algorithm, Graph-Partially Supervised Learning (Graph-PSL), to solve the problem of document classification with positive and unlabeled documents. The key characteristic of the problem is that labeled negative documents are missing. We present a graph-based method to identify reliable negative documents and theoretically explain it by lazy information transfer network. The documents are classified by Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM), which can explore the information contained in unlabeled data. We explain how the similarity matrix of the graph and the kernel matrix in TSVM are calculated. We apply Graph-PSL to 20 Newsgroup dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that Graph-PSL identifies negative documents accurately and classifies the unlabeled ones more effectively and more robustly compared to Bayesian based algorithms.

AB During the past decade, procedures for forest biomass quantification from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data have been improved at a rapid pace. The scope of these methods ranges from simple regression between LiDAR-derived height metrics and biomass to methods including automated tree crown delineation, stochastic simulation, and machine learning approaches. This study compared the effectiveness of four modeling techniques-linear mixed-effects (LME) regression, random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR). and Cubist-for estimating biomass in moderately dense forest (40-60% canopy closure) at both tree and plot levels. Tree crowns were delineated to provide model estimates of individual tree biomass.and investigate the effects of delineation accuracy on biomass modeling. We used our previously developed method (COTH) to delineate tree crowns. Results indicate that biomass estimation accuracy improves when modeled at the plot level and that SVR produced the most accurate biomass model (671 kg RMSE per 380 m(2) plot when forest plots were modeled as a collection of trees). All models provided similar results when estimating biomass at the individual tree level (505, 506, 457, and 502 kg RMSE per tree). We assessed the effect of crown delineation accuracy on biomass estimation by repeating the modeling procedures with manually delineated crowns as inputs. Results indicated that manually delineated crowns did not always produce superior biomass models and that the relationship between crown delineation accuracy and biomass estimation accuracy is complex and needs to be further investigated.

AB Purpose: To study, from a machine learning perspective, the performance of several machine learning classifiers that use texture analysis features extracted from soft-tissue tumors in nonenhanced T1-MRI images to discriminate between malignant and benign tumors.
   Materials and Methods: Texture analysis features were extracted from the tumor regions from T1-MRI images of clinically proven cases of 49 malignant and 86 benign soft-tissue tumors. Three conventional machine learning classifiers were trained and tested. The best classifier was compared to the radiologists by means of the McNemar's statistical test.
   Results: The SVM classifier performs better than the neural network and the C4.5 decision tree based on the analysis of their receiver operating curves (ROC) and cost curves. The classification accuracy of the SVM, which was 93% (91% specificity; 94% sensitivity), was better than the radiologist classification accuracy of 90% (92% specificity: 81% sensitivity).
   Conclusion: Machine learning classifiers trained with texture analysis features are potentially valuable for detecting malignant tumors in T1-MRI images. Analysis of the learning curves of the classifiers showed that a training data size smaller than 100 T1-MRI images is sufficient to train a machine learning classifier that performs as well as expert radiologists.

AB "BCI illiteracy" is one of the biggest problems and challenges in BC! research. It means that BCI control cannot be achieved by a non-negligible number of subjects (estimated 20% to 25%). There are two main causes for BCI illiteracy in BCI users: either no SMR idle rhythm is observed over motor areas, or this idle rhythm is not attenuated during motor imagery, resulting in a classification performance lower than 70% (criterion level) already for offline calibration data. In a previous work of the same authors, the concept of machine learning based co-adaptive calibration was introduced. This new type of calibration provided substantially improved performance for a variety of users. Here, we use a similar approach and investigate to what extent co-adapting learning enables substantial BCI control for completely novice users and those who suffered from BCI illiteracy before.

AB Background: Automated systems have been broadly used in the counting of particles in urine, while manual microscopic analyses are still required for confirming components of urine sediments, especially pathologic casts and other unknown particles. Good review rules can reduce the number of manual urine microscopy examinations safely, thereby increasing productivity. Although several methods have been proposed, establishment of microscopic review rules for flow cytometer remains challenging.
   Methods: A total of 3014 urine samples from outpatient and inpatient were examined using UF-1000i flow cytometry, Urisys-2400 dipstick and RS 2003 urine sediment workstation, respectively. Based on the results above, three supervised machine learning methods were employed to construct classifiers for screening urine samples.
   Results: Here, we propose a novel method for construction of microscopic review rules, termed UrineCART, which was based on a classification and regression tree (CART) method. With a cut-off value of 0.0745 for UrineCART, we obtained a sensitivity of 92.0%, a specificity of 81.5% and a total review rate of 32.4% on an independent test set. Comparisons with the existing methods showed that UrineCART gave the acceptable sensitivity and lower total review rate.
   Conclusions: An algorithm based on machine learning methods for review criteria can be achieved via systematic comparison of UF-1000i flow cytometry and microscopy. Using UrineCART, our microscopic review rate can be reduced to around 30%, while decreasing significant losses in urinalysis.

AB Myoelectric signal classification is one of the most difficult pattern recognition problems because large variations in surface electromyogram features usually exist. In the literature, attempts have been made to apply various pattern recognition methods to classify surface electromyography into components corresponding to the activities of different muscles, but this has not been very successful, as some muscles are bigger and more active than others. This results in dataset discrepancy during classification. Multicategory classification problems are usually solved by solving many, one-versus-rest binary classification tasks. These subtasks unsurprisingly involve unbalanced datasets. Consequently, we need a learning methodology that can take into account unbalanced datasets in addition to large variations in the distributions of patterns corresponding to different classes. Here, we attempt to address the above issues using hybrid features extracted from independent component analysis and twin support vector machine techniques.

AB We develop and test an active-machine-learning method to select questions adaptively when consumers use heuristic decision rules. The method tailors priors to each consumer based on a "configurator." Subsequent questions maximize information about the decision heuristics (minimize expected posterior entropy). To update posteriors after each question, we approximate the posterior with a variational distribution and use belief propagation (iterative loops of Bayes updating). The method runs sufficiently fast to select new queries in under a second and provide significantly and substantially more information per question than existing methods based on random, market-based, or orthogonal-design questions.
   Synthetic data experiments demonstrate that adaptive questions provide close-to-optimal information and outperform existing methods even when there are response errors or "bad" priors. The basic algorithm focuses on conjunctive or disjunctive rules, but we demonstrate generalizations to more complex heuristics and to the use of previous-respondent data to improve consumer-specific priors. We illustrate the algorithm empirically in a Web-based survey conducted by an American automotive manufacturer to study vehicle consideration (872 respondents, 53 feature levels). Adaptive questions outperform market-based questions when estimating heuristic decision rules. Heuristic decision rules predict validation decisions better than compensatory rules.

AB Automatic vectorization is critical to enhancing performance of compute-intensive programs on modern processors. However, there is much room for improvement over the auto-vectorization capabilities of current production compilers through careful vector-code synthesis that utilizes a variety of loop transformations (e.g., unroll-and-jam, interchange, etc.).
   As the set of transformations considered is increased, the selection of the most effective combination of transformations becomes a significant challenge: Currently used cost models in vectorizing compilers are often unable to identify the best choices. In this paper, we address this problem using machine learning models to predict the performance of SIMD codes. In contrast to existing approaches that have used high-level features of the program, we develop machine learning models based on features extracted from the generated assembly code. The models are trained offline on a number of benchmarks and used at compile-time to discriminate between numerous possible vectorized variants generated from the input code.
   We demonstrate the effectiveness of the machine learning model by using it to guide automatic vectorization on a variety of tensor contraction kernels, with improvements ranging from 2x to 8 x over Intel ICC's auto-vectorized code. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the model on a number of stencil computations and show good improvement over auto-vectorized code.

AB Clozapine (CLZ) is uniquely effective as a treatment for medication resistant schizophrenia. Information regarding its mechanism of action may offer clues to the pathophysiology of the disease and to improved treatment. In this study we employ a machine learning (ML) analysis of P300 evoked potentials obtained from quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) data to identify changes in the brain induced by CLZ treatment. We employ brain source localization (BSL) on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from specified regions of the brain. A subset of 8 features is selected from a large set of candidate features (consisting of spectral coherences between all identified source waveforms at multiple frequencies) that discriminate (by means of a classifier) between the pre- and post-treatment data for the schizophrenics (SCZ) most responsive to CLZ. We show these same selected features also discriminate between pre-treatment most responsive SCZ and healthy volunteers (HV), but not after treatment. Of note, these same features discriminate the least responsive SCZ from HV both pre- and post-treatment. This analysis suggests that the net beneficial effects of CLZ in SCZ are reflected in a normalization of P300 brain-source generators.

AB In this paper, a novel evolutionary programming (EP) based asymmetric weighted least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) ensemble learning methodology is proposed for software repository mining. In this methodology, an asymmetric weighted LSSVM model is first proposed. Then the process of building the EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology is described in detail. Two publicly available software defect datasets are finally used for illustration and verification of the effectiveness of the proposed EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology. Experimental results reveal that the proposed EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology can produce promising classification accuracy in software repository mining, relative to other classification methods listed in this study.

AB In this paper, we introduce a single-machine scheduling model considering all of the following parameters: general deterioration and learning effects as well as general setup times. We prove that the shortest processing time (SPT) rule produces optimal schedules for the following seven minimization objectives: makespan, sum of alpha th (alpha >= 0) power of jobs' completion times, total weighted completion time, maximum lateness, total tardiness, total weighted tardiness, and number of tardy jobs. We further show that in the case of resumable scheduling with availability constraints, the above conclusions are still valid.

AB Rapid strides are being made to bring to reality the technology of wearable sensors for monitoring patients' physiological data. We study the problem of automatically detecting anomalies in the measured blood glucose levels. The normal daily measurements of the patient are used to train a hidden Markov model (HMM). The structure of the HMM its states and output symbols are selected to accurately model the typical transitions in blood glucose levels throughout a 24-hour period. The learning of the HMM is done using historic data of normal measurements. The HMM can then be used to detect anomalies in blood glucose levels being measured, if the inferred likelihood of the observed data is low in the world described by the HMM. Our simulation results show that our technique is accurate in detecting anomalies in glucose levels and is robust (i.e., no false positives) in the presence of reasonable changes in the patient's daily routine.

AB One of the challenges in effective software engineering (SE) education is the lack of objective assessment methods of how well student teams learn the critically needed teamwork practices, defined as the ability: (i) to learn and effectively apply SE processes in a teamwork setting, and (ii) to work as a team to develop satisfactory software (SW) products. In addition, there are no effective methods for predicting learning effectiveness in order to enable early intervention in the classroom. Most of the current approaches to assess achievement of SE teamwork skills rely solely on qualitative and subjective data taken as surveys at the end of the class and analyzed only with very rudimentary data analysis. In this paper we present a novel approach to address the assessment and prediction of student learning of teamwork effectiveness in software engineering education based on: a) extracting only objective and quantitative student team activity data during their team class project; b) pairing these data with related independent observations and grading of student team effectiveness in SE process and SE product components in order to create "training database"; and c) applying a machine learning (ML) approach, namely random forest classification (RF), to the above training database in order to create ML models, ranked factors and rules that can both explain (e.g. assess) as well as provide prediction of the student teamwork effectiveness. These student team activity data are being collected in joint and already established (since 2006) SE classes at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Fulda University, Germany (Fulda), from approximately 80 students each year, working in about 15 teams, both local and global (with students from multiple schools).

AB An air handling unit's energy usage can vary from the original design as components fail or fault - dampers leak or fail to open/close, valves get stuck, and so on. Such problems do not necessarily result in occupant complaints and, consequently, are not even recognized to have occurred. In spite of recent progress in the research and development of diagnostic solutions for air handling units, there is still a lack of reliable, scalable, and affordable diagnostic solutions for such systems. Modeling limitations, measurement constraints, and the complexity of concurrent faults are the main challenges in air handling unit diagnostics. The focus of this paper is on developing diagnostic algorithms for air handling units that can address such constraints more effectively by systematically employing machine-learning techniques. The proposed algorithms are based on analyzing the observed behavior of the system and comparing it with a set of behavioral patterns generated based on various faulty conditions. We show how such a pattern-matching problem can be formulated as an estimation of the posterior distribution of a Bayesian probabilistic model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by detecting faults in commercial building air handling units. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Query Expansion; Social Annotation; Learning to Rank
AB Automatic query expansion technologies have been proven to be effective in many information retrieval tasks. Most existing approaches are based on the assumption that the most informative terms in top-retrieved documents can be viewed as context of the query and thus can be used for query expansion. One problem with these approaches is that some of the expansion terms extracted from feedback documents are irrelevant to the query, and thus may hurt the retrieval performance. In social annotations, users provide different keywords describing the respective Web pages from various aspects. These features may be used to boost IR performance. However, to date, the potential of social annotation for this task has been largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore the possibility and potential of social annotation as a new resource for extracting useful expansion terms. In particular, we propose a term ranking approach based on social annotation resource. The proposed approach consists of two phases: (1) in the first phase, we propose a term-dependency method to choose the most likely expansion terms; (2) in the second phase, we develop a machine learning method for term ranking, which is learnt from the statistics of the candidate expansion terms, using ListNet. Experimental results on three TREC test collections show that the retrieval performance can be improved when the term ranking method is used. In addition, we also demonstrate that terms selected by the term-dependency method from social annotation resources are beneficial to improve the retrieval performance.

AB Objectives: The development of better biomarkers for disease assessment remains an ongoing effort across the spectrum of neurologic illnesses. One approach for refining biomarkers is based on the concept of machine learning, in which individual, unrelated biomarkers are simultaneously evaluated. In this cross-sectional study, we assess the possibility of using machine learning, incorporating both quantitative muscle ultrasound (QMU) and electrical impedance myography (EIM) data, for classification of muscles affected by spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
   Methods: Twenty-one normal subjects, 15 subjects with SMA type 2, and 10 subjects with SMA type 3 underwent EIM and QMU measurements of unilateral biceps, wrist extensors, quadriceps, and tibialis anterior. EIM and QMU parameters were then applied in combination using a support vector machine (SVM), a type of machine learning, in an attempt to accurately categorize 165 individual muscles.
   Results: For all 3 classification problems, normal vs SMA, normal vs SMA 3, and SMA 2 vs SMA 3, use of SVM provided the greatest accuracy in discrimination, surpassing both EIM and QMU individually. For example, the accuracy, as measured by the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) for the SVM discriminating SMA 2 muscles from SMA 3 muscles was 0.928; in comparison, the ROC-AUCs for EIM and QMU parameters alone were only 0.877 (p < 0.05) and 0.627 (p < 0.05), respectively.
   Conclusions: Combining EIM and QMU data categorizes individual SMA-affected muscles with very high accuracy. Further investigation of this approach for classifying and for following the progression of neuromuscular illness is warranted. Neurology (R) 2012;79:358-364

This paper applies ensemble learning using both Bagging and Boosting to parameter tuning in SVM. It will be shown that the proposed method is effective in particular for large scale data sets and for imbalanced data sets.

AB The support vector machine is a supervised learning technique for classification increasingly used in many applications of data mining, engineering, and bioinformatics. This chapter aims to provide ail introduction to the method, covering from the basic concept of the optimal separating hyperplane to its nonlinear generalization through kernels. A general framework of kernel methods that encompass the support vector machine as a special case is outlined. In addition, statistical properties that illuminate both advantage and limitation of the method due to its specific mechanism for classification are briefly discussed. For illustration of the method and related practical issues, an application to real data with high-dimensional features is presented.

AB USARSim group at NIST developed a simulated robot that operated in the Unreal Tournament 3 (UT3) gaming environment. They used a software PID controller to control the robot in UT3 worlds. Unfortunately, the PID controller did not work well, so NIST asked us to develop a better controller using machine learning techniques. In the process, we characterized the software PID controller and the robot's behavior in UT3 worlds. Using data collected from our simulations, we compared different machine learning techniques including linear regression and reinforcement learning (RL). Finally, we implemented a RL based controller in Mat lab and ran it in the UT3 environment via a TCP/IP link between Mat lab and UT3.

AB After an association between genetic variants and a phenotype has been established, further study goals comprise the classification of patients according to disease risk or the estimation of disease probability. To accomplish this, different statistical methods are required, and specifically machine-learning approaches may offer advantages over classical techniques. In this paper, we describe methods for the construction and evaluation of classification and probability estimation rules. We review the use of machine-learning approaches in this context and explain some of the machine-learning algorithms in detail. Finally, we illustrate the methodology through application to a genome-wide association analysis on rheumatoid arthritis.

AB With the rapid development of Internet, online information has greatly enriched. The Internet becomes a vast treasure of information, but simultaneously it is also flooding various trash information, such as: viruses, Trojans, violence, pornography, gambling and so on. The hostile forces outside of country and criminal elements are using the Internet to engage in illegal activities that endanger national security. So how to recognize this information to find the corresponding website and to carry on the effective supervision has become an urgent problem. For these reasons, this paper designs a new web information extraction system, which calls the extraction rule corresponding to the template by calculating the structural similarity among pages. In addition, a new method based on STU-DOM tree to construct decision tree is proposed. This method can use the classification of decision tree to determine sensitive information node.

AB Due to the increasing usage of complex materials in lightweight design the development of proper material models for the prediction of damage and failure within Finite Element simulations has become an extensive task. Other fields of application already have shown that the introduction of Soft Computing and Machine Learning methods can be very beneficial for getting the complexity under control. The contribution aims at sketching a systematic approach to the application of machine learning methods in the field of material modelling. The focus is put not only on the definition of well performing mathematical models, but also on process aspects of generating and maintaining the mathematical models within reproducible, requirement driven and controlled iterative environments for Computer Aided Engineering.

AB Considering the multiple instance learning(MIL) in classification problem, a novel multiple instance twin support vector machines(MI-TWSVM) method is proposed. For linear classification, unlike other maximum margin SVM-based MIL methods, the proposed approach leads to two non-parallel hyperplanes. The non-linear classification via kernels is also studied. Preliminary experimental results on public datasets indicate that our MIL method is competitive with the previous MIL methods.

AB This paper presents a novel method for generally adapting ordinal classification models. We essentially rely on the assumption that the ordinal structure of the set of class labels is also reflected in the topology of the instance space. Under this assumption, this paper proposes an algorithm in two phases that takes advantage of the ordinal structure of the dataset and tries to translate this ordinal structure in the total ordered real line and then to rank the patterns of the dataset. The first phase makes a projection of the ordinal structure of the feature space. Next, an evolutionary algorithm tunes the first projection working with the misclassified patterns near the border of their right class. The results obtained in seven ordinal datasets are competitive in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms in ordinal regression, but with much less computational time in datasets with many patterns.

AB In this paper we evaluate the performance of machine learning methods in the task of predicting the bonding state of cysteines starting from protein sequences. This task is the first step for the identification of disulfide bonds in proteins. We score the performance of three different approaches: 1) Hidden Support Vector Machines (HSVMs) which integrate the SVM predictions with a Hidden Markov Model; 2) SVM-HMMs which discriminatively train models that are isomorphic to a kth-order hidden Markov model; 3) Grammatical-Restrained Hidden Conditional Random Fields (GRHCRFs) that we recently introduced. We evaluate two different encoding schemes based on sequence profile and position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) as computed with the PSI-BLAST program and we show that when the evolutionary information is encoded with PSSM all the methods perform better than with sequence profile. Among the different methods it appears that GRHCRFs perform slightly better than the others achieving a per protein accuracy of 87% with a Matthews correlation coefficient (C) of 0.73. Finally, we investigate the difference between disulfide bonding state predictions in Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes. Our analysis shows that the per-protein accuracy in Prokaryotic proteins is higher than that in Eukaryotes (0.88 vs 0.83). However; given the paucity of bonded cysteines in Prokaryotes as compared to Eukaryotes the Matthews correlation coefficient is drastically reduced (0.48 vs 0.80).

AB The talk presents several machine learning techniques and their applications to clinical decision-making. In many problems of computer-aided medical diagnosis and treatment a program must be capable of learning from previously accumulated past patients data records, and extrapolating to make diagnosis for new patient by considering their symptoms. Many machine learning and statisitical techniques have been developed to help in clinical decision making. Among them decision trees, the Bayesian techniques, dicriminant analysis, neural networks and many others. These techniques usually deal with conventional, small-scale, low-dimensional problems, and the application of these techniques to modern high-dimensional data sets with many thousand attributes (symptoms) usually leads to serious computational problems. Several new techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been developed to tackle the problem of dimensionality by transferring the problem into high-dimensional space, and solving it in that space. They based on so-called kernal methods and can very often solve some high-dimensional problems. These techniques perform very well with good accuracy. However, a typical drawback of techniques such as the SVM is that they usually do not provide any useful measure of confidence of new, unclassified examples (new pattients). Recently a new set of techniques, called Conformal Predictors, have been developed that allows to make predictions with valid measures of confidence. The approach is based on approximations to the universal measures of confidence given by the algorithmic theory of randomness and allows us to compute diagnostic classes and estimate confidence of the diagnostics for high-dimensional data. The talk will present Conformal Predictors and their applications in medicine.

AB This paper reports on the empirical comparison of seven machine learning algorithms in texture classification with application to vegetation management in power line corridors. Aiming at classifying tree species in power line corridors, object-based method is employed. Individual tree crowns are segmented as the basic classification units and three classic texture features are extracted as the input to the classification algorithms. Several widely used performance metrics are used to evaluate the classification algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the classification performance depends on the performance matrix, the characteristics of datasets and the feature used.

AB In order to solve the hidden-layer neuron determination problem of regularized extreme learning machine (RELM) applied to chaotic time series prediction, a new algorithm based on Cholesky factorization is proposed. First, an RELM-based prediction model with one hidden-layer neuron is constructed and then a new hidden-layer neuron is added to the prediction model in each training step until the generalization performance of the prediction model reaches its peak value. Thus, the optimal network structure of the prediction model is determined. In the training procedure, Cholesky factorization is used to calculate the output weights of RELM. Experiments on chaotic time series prediction indicate that the algorithm can be effectively used to determine the optimal network strueture of RELM, and the prediction model trained by the algorithm has excellent performance in prediction accuracy and computational cost.

AB Accuracy alone can be deceptive when evaluating the performance of a classifier, especially if the problem involves a high number of classes. This paper proposes an approach used for dealing with multi-class problems, which tries to avoid this issue. The approach is based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier, which is trained by using a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. Two error measures (Accuracy, C, and Sensitivity, S) are combined and applied as a fitness function for the algorithm. The proposed approach is able to obtain multiclass classifiers with a high classification rate level in the global dataset with an acceptable level of accuracy for each class. This methodology is evaluated over seven benchmark classification problems and one real problem, obtaining promising results.

AB In many realistic situation, a job processed later consumes more time than the same job when it is processed earlier, this phenomenon is known as deteriorated effect. The skills of workers continuously improve when repeating the same or similar tasks, this phenomenon is as the "learning effect" in the literature. However, most studies considering the deteriorated and learning effect ignore the fact that production efficiency can be increased by grouping various parts and products with similar designs and/or production processes. This phenomenon is known "group technology" in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new group scheduling with deteriorated and learning model where the learning effect not only depends on job position, but also depends on the group position; the deteriorated effect depends on its starting time of the job. We then show that the single-machine makespan and the total completion time problems remain polynomial optimal solvable under the proposed model. In addition, we show the maximum lateness have a polynomial optimal solution under certain agreeable restriction. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Interest has been growing within HCI on the use of machine learning and reasoning in applications to classify such hidden states as user intentions, based on observations. HCI researchers with these interests typically have little expertise in machine learning and often employ toolkits as relatively fixed "black boxes" for generating statistical classifiers. However, attempts to tailor the performance of classifiers to specific application requirements may require a more sophisticated understanding and custom-tailoring of methods. We present ManiMatrix, a system that provides controls and visualizations that enable system builders to refine the behavior of classification systems in an intuitive manner. With ManiMatrix, users directly refine parameters of a confusion matrix via an interactive cycle of reclassification and visualization. We present the core methods and evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in a user study. Results show that users are able to quickly and effectively modify decision boundaries of classifiers to tailor the behavior of classifiers to problems at hand.

AB Classification is one of the most widely applied tasks in ecology. Ecologists have to deal with noisy, high-dimensional data that often are non-linear and do not meet the assumptions of conventional statistical procedures. To overcome this problem, machine-learning methods have been adopted as ecological classification methods. We compared five machine-learning based classification techniques (classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and automatically induced rule-based fuzzy models) in a biological conservation context. The study case was that of the ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata), a bird endemic to the Yucatan peninsula that has suffered considerable decreases in local abundance and distributional area during the last few decades. On a grid of 10x 10 km cells that was superimposed to the peninsula we analysed relationships between environmental and social explanatory variables and ocellated turkey abundance changes between 1980 and 2000. Abundance was expressed in three (decrease, no change, and increase) and 14 more detailed abundance change classes, respectively. Modelling performance varied considerably between methods with random forests and classification trees being the most efficient ones as measured by overall classification error and the normalised mutual information index. Artificial neural networks yielded the worst results along with linear discriminant analysis, which was included as a conventional statistical approach. We not only evaluated classification accuracy but also characteristics such as time effort, classifier comprehensibility and method intricacy aspects that determine the success of a classification technique among ecologists and conservation biologists as well as for the communication with managers and decision makers. We recommend the combined use of classification trees and random forests due to the easy interpretability of classifiers and the high comprehensibility of the method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper considers an identical parallel machine scheduling problem when there are position-based deteriorating jobs with setup and removal times that are affected by the position-based learning effect. The aim of the problem is to minimize the sum of the total tardiness and earliness, minimize the number of tardy jobs and minimize the mean completion times. As a result, the mathematical model is developed for the above-mentioned problem. Since this problem belongs to NP-hard classes, three heuristic methods, namely shortest processing time (SPT), earliest due date (EDD) and longest processing time (LPT), are developed. Furthermore, some numerical experiments are designed to compare the performance of these different methods.

DE inductive learning; machine learning; information systems; knowledge
   acquisition
AB Machine learning attempts to build computer programs that improve their performance by automating the acquisition of knowledge from experience. Inductive learning, one of machine learning paradigms, draws inductive inference from a teacher or environment-provided facts. Inductive learning enables the program to identify regularities and patterns in the prior knowledge or training data, and then to extract them as generalized rules. In literature there are proposed two ways of machine learning usage in information systems: (1) for building tools for software development and maintenance tasks and (2) for incorporation into software products to make them adaptive and self-configuring. However, considering information systems in more detail, division in three situations of inductive learning use in the context of information systems can be proposed, namely, first, in the information system development project management, second, to collect the information that is to be built in information system, third, to help the information system to adapt to the changing environment. The analysis of inductive learning role in information system development and usage is given. The future directions point to the e-commerce and similar domains on the Web for the role of inductive learning in information systems.

AB Background The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) and its promoter (5-HTTLPR) polymorphism have been the focus of a large number of association studies of behavioral traits and psychiatric disorders. However, large-scale genotyping of the polymorphism has been very difficult. We report the development and validation of a 5-HTTLPR genotype prediction model.
   Methods The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the 2000 kb region surrounding 5-HTTLPR were used to construct a prediction model through a newly developed machine learning method, multicategory vertex discriminant analysis with 2147 individuals from the Northern Finnish Birth Cohort genotyped with the Illumina 370K SNP array and manually genotyped for 5-HTTLPR polymorphism. The prediction model was applied to SNP genotypes in a Dutch/German schizophrenia case-control sample of 3318 individuals to test the association of the polymorphism with schizophrenia.
   Result The prediction model of eight SNPs achieved a 92.4% accuracy rate and a 0.98 +/- 0.01 area under the receiving operating characteristic. Evidence for an association of the polymorphism with schizophrenia was observed (P=0.05, odds ratio=1.105).
   Conclusion This prediction model provides an effective substitute of manually genotyped 5-HTTLPR alleles, providing a new approach for large scale association studies of this polymorphism. Psychiatr Genet 22:182-188 (c) 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB The complexity of breast cancer biology makes it challenging to analyze large datasets of clinicopathologic and molecular attributes, toward identifying the key prognostic features and producing systems capable of predicting which patients are likely to relapse. We applied machine-learning techniques to analyze a set of well-characterized primary breast cancers, which specified the abundance and localization of various junctional proteins. We hypothesized that disruption of junctional complexes would lead to the cytoplasmic/nuclear redistribution of the protein components and their potential interactions with growth-regulating molecules, which would promote relapse, and that machine-learning techniques could use the subcellular locations of these proteins, together with standard clinicopathological data, to produce an efficient prognostic classifier. We used immunohistochemistry to assess the expression and subcellular distribution of six junctional proteins, in addition to a panel of eight standard clinical features and concentrations of four "growth-regulating" proteins, to produce a database involving 36 features, over 66 primary invasive ductal breast carcinomas. A machine-learning system was applied to this clinicopathologic dataset to produce a decision-tree classifier that could predict whether a novel breast cancer patient would relapse. We show that this decision-tree classifier, which incorporates a combination of only four features (nuclear alpha-and beta-catenin levels, the total level of PTEN and the number of involved axillary lymph nodes), is able to correctly classify patient outcomes essentially 80% of the time. Further, this classifier is significantly better than classifiers based on any subgroup of these 36 features. This study demonstrates that autonomous machine-learning techniques are able to generate simple and efficient decision-tree prognostic classifiers from a wide variety of clinical, pathologic and biomarker data, and unlike other analytic methods, suggest testable biologic relationships among explicitly identified key variables. The decision-tree classifier resulting from these analytic methods is sufficiently simple and should be widely applicable to a spectrum of clinical cancer settings. Further, the subcellular distribution of junctional proteins, which influences growth regulatory pathways involved in locoregional and metastatic relapse of breast cancer, helped to identify which patients would relapse while their total concentration did not. This emphasizes the need to evaluate the subcellular distribution of junctional proteins in assessing their contribution to tumor progression.

AB We trained generative models and decision tree classifiers with positive and negative examples of the neo-plastic works of Piet Mondrian to infer his compositional principles, to generate "faux" works, and to explore the possibility of computer-based aids in authentication and attribution studies. Unlike previous computer work on this and other artists, we used "earlier state" works-intermediate versions of works created by Mondrian revealed through x-radiography and infra-red reflectography-when training our classifiers. Such intermediate state works provide a great deal of information to a classifier as they differ only slightly from the final works. We used methods from machine learning such as leave-one-out cross validation. Our decision tree classifier had accuracy of roughly 70% in recognizing the genuine works of Mondrian versus computer-generated replicas with similar statistical properties. Our trained classifier reveals implicit compositional principles underlying Mondrian's works, for instance the relative visual "weights" of the four colors (red, yellow, blue and black) he used in his rectangles. We used our trained generative model to generate "faux" Mondrians, which informally possess some of the compositional attributes of genuine works by this artist.

By learning effects, deteriorating jobs and group technology assumption, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by the function of its starting time and position in the group, and the group setup times of a group is a positive strictly decreasing continuous function of the amount of consumed resource. We present polynomial solutions for the makespan minimization problem under the constraint that the total resource consumption does not exceed a given limit, and the total resource consumption minimization problem under the constraint that the makespan does not exceed a given limit, respectively.

AB Ordinal regression is one of the most important tasks of relation learning, and several techniques based on support vector machines (SVMs) have also been proposed for tackling it, but the scalability aspect of these approaches to handle large datasets still needs much of exploration. In this paper, we will extend the recent proposed algorithm Core Vector Machine (CVM) to the ordinal-class data, and propose a new algorithm named as Ordinal-Class Core Vector Machine (OCVM). Similar with CVM, its asymptotic time complexity is linear with the number of training samples, while the space complexity is independent with the number of training samples. We also give some analysis for OCVM, which mainly includes two parts, the first one shows that OCVM can guarantee that the biases are unique and properly ordered under some situation; the second one illustrates the approximate convergence of the solution from the viewpoints of objective function and KKT conditions. Experiments on several synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate that OCVM scales well with the size of the dataset and can achieve comparable generalization performance with existing SVM implementations.

AB The immune system is characterized by high combinatorial complexity that necessitates the use of specialized computational tools for analysis of immunological data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are used in combination with classical experimentation for the selection of vaccine targets and in computational simulations that reduce the number of necessary experiments. The development of ML algorithms requires standardized data sets, consistent measurement methods, and uniform scales. To bridge the gap between the immunology community and the ML community, we designed a repository for machine learning in immunology named Dana-Farber Repository for Machine Learning in Immunology (DFRMLI). This repository provides standardized data sets of HLA-binding peptides with all binding affinities mapped onto a common scale. It also provides a list of experimentally validated naturally processed T cell epitopes derived from tumor or virus antigens. The DFRMLI data were preprocessed and ensure consistency, comparability, detailed descriptions, and statistically meaningful sample sizes for peptides that bind to various HLA molecules. The repository is accessible at http://bio.dfci.harvard.edu/DFRMLI/. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is common to start a course on computer programming logic by teaching the algorithm concept from the point of view of natural languages, but in a schematic way. In this sense we note that the students have difficulties in understanding and implementation of the problems proposed by the teacher. The main idea of this paper is to show that the logical reasoning of computer programming students can be efficiently developed by using at the same time Turing Machine, cellular automata (Wolfram rule) and fractals theory via Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The results indicate that this approach is useful, but the teacher needs introducing, in an interdisciplinary context, the simple theory of cellular automata and the fractals before the problem implementation.

AB An automatic system for the diagnosis of lung cancer has been proposed in this manuscript. The proposed method is based on combination of genetic algorithm (GA) for the feature selection and newly proposed approach, namely the extreme learning machines (ELM) for the classification of lung cancer data. The dimension of the feature space is reduced by the GA in this scheme and the effective features are selected in this way. The data are then fed to a fuzzy inference system (FIS) which is trained by the fuzzy extreme learning machines approach. The results on real data indicate that the proposed system is very effective in the diagnosis of lung cancer and can be used for clinical applications.

ID SELECTION; LIKENESS
AB High throughput screening (HTS) remains a very costly process notwithstanding many recent technological advances in the field of biotechnology. In this study we consider the application of machine learning methods for predicting experimental HTS measurements. Such a virtual HTS analysis can be based on the results of real HTS campaigns carried out with similar compounds libraries and similar drug targets. In this way, we analyzed Test assay from McMaster University Data Mining and Docking Competition [1] using binary decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors and partial least squares. First, we studied separately the sets of molecular and atomic descriptors in order to establish which of them provides a better prediction. Then, the comparison of the six considered machine learning methods was made in terms of false positives and false negatives, method's sensitivity and enrichment factor. Finally, a variable selection procedure allowing one to improve the method's sensitivity was implemented and applied in the framework of polynomial SVM.

AB This paper deals with a single machine scheduling problem with general past-sequence-dependent (psd) setup time and log-linear learning in which the setup times and learning effects are job-dependent. The setup times are unique functions of the length of already processed jobs, and the learning effects show that processing times are unique decreasing functions of job positions. The goal is to find the optimal sequences that minimise objective functions such as the makespan, total completion time, total lateness, total waiting cost, total waiting time, total absolute differences in completion times, and the sum of earliness, tardiness and common due date penalty. Special cases of the resulting problems are solvable in polynomial time; however, the general problems are difficult to solve. We propose branch-and-bound (B&B) methods to derive the optimal sequences for such problems. Computational results show that the proposed methods can solve relatively large problem instances in reasonable amounts of time.

AB We demonstrate a hybrid machine learning method to classify schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. The method consists of four stages: (1) SNPs with the most discriminating information between the healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are selected to construct a support vector machine ensemble (SNP-SVME). (2) Voxels in the fMRI map contributing to classification are selected to build another SVME (Voxel-SVME). (3) Components of fMRI activation obtained with independent component analysis (ICA) are used to construct a single SVM classifier (ICA-SVMC). (4) The above three models are combined into a single module using a majority voting approach to make a final decision (Combined SNP-fMRI). The method was evaluated by a fully validated leave-one-out method using 40 subjects (20 patients and 20 controls). The classification accuracy was: 0.74 for SNP-SVME, 0.82 for Voxel-SVME, 0.83 for ICA-SVMC, and 0.87 for Combined SNP-fMRI. Experimental results show that better classification accuracy was achieved by combining genetic and fMRI data than using either alone, indicating that genetic and brain function representing different, but partially complementary aspects, of schizophrenia etiopathology. This study suggests an effective way to reassess biological classification of individuals with schizophrenia, which is also potentially useful for identifying diagnostically important markers for the disorder.

AB We give sublinear-time approximation algorithms for some optimization problems arising in machine learning, such as training linear classifiers and finding minimum enclosing balls. Our algorithms can be extended to some kernelized versions of these problems, such as SVDD, hard margin SVM, and L-2-SVM, for which sublinear-time algorithms were not known before. These new algorithms use a combination of a novel sampling techniques and a new multiplicative update algorithm. We give lower bounds which show the running times of many of our algorithms to be nearly best possible in the unit-cost RAM model. We also give implementations of our algorithms in the semi-streaming setting, obtaining the first low pass polylogarithmic space and sublinear time algorithms achieving arbitrary approximation factor.

AB In this paper, we present a detailed evaluation of a set of well-known Machine Learning classifiers in front of dynamic and non-deterministic software anomalies. The system state prediction is based on monitoring system metrics. This allows software proactive rejuvenation to be triggered automatically. Random Forest approach achieves validation errors less than 1% in comparison to the well-known ML algorithms under avaluation.
   In order to reduce automatically the number of monitored parameters, needed to predict software anomalies, we analyze Lasso Regularization technique jointly with the Machine Learning classifiers to evaluate how the prediction accuracy could be guaranteed within an acceptable threshold. This allows to reduce drastically (around 60% in the best case) the number of monitoring parameters. The framework, based on ML and Lasso regularization techniques, has been validated using an e-commerce environment with Apache Tomcat server, and MySql database server.

AB Growth of Internet usage and content provides us with large amounts of free text information, which could be used to extend our data mining capabilities and to collect specialist knowledge from different reliable sources.
   In this paper we explore the possibility for a reuse of 'old' data mining results, which seemed to be well exploited at the time of their formation, but are now laying stored in so called knowledge tombs. By using the web based text mined knowledge we are going to verify knowledge, gathered in the knowledge tombs.
   We focused on re-evaluation of rules, coming from symbolic machine learning (ML) approaches, like decision trees, rough sets, association rules and ensemble approaches.
   The knowledge source for ML rule evaluation is the web based text mined knowledge, aimed to complement and sometimes replace the domain expert in the early stages.

AB Pain assessment in patients who are unable to verbally communicate is a challenging problem. The fundamental limitations in pain assessment in neonates stem from subjective assessment criteria, rather than quantifiable and measurable data. This often results in poor quality and inconsistent treatment of patient pain management. Recent advancements in pattern recognition techniques using relevance vector machine (RVM) learning techniques can assist medical staff in assessing pain by constantly monitoring the patient and providing the clinician with quantifiable data for pain management. The RVM classification technique is a Bayesian extension of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which achieves comparable performance to SVM while providing posterior probabilities for class memberships and a sparser model. If classes represent "pure" facial expressions (i.e., extreme expressions that an observer can identify with a high degree of confidence), then the posterior probability of the membership of some intermediate facial expression to a class can provide an estimate of the intensity of such an expression. In this paper, we use the RVM classification technique to distinguish pain from nonpain in neonates as well as assess their pain intensity levels. We also correlate our results with the pain intensity assessed by expert and nonexpert human examiners.

AB Stability with first time or reactivated landslides depends upon the residual shear strength of soil. This paper describes prediction of the residual strength of soil based on index properties using two machine learning techniques. Different Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques have been used. SVM aims at minimizing a bound on the generalization error of a model rather than at minimizing the error on the training data only. The ANN models along with their generalizations capabilities are presented here for comparisons. This study also highlights the capability of SVM model over ANN models for the prediction of the residual strength of soil. Based on different statistical parameters, the SVM model is found to be better than the developed ANN models. A model equation has been developed for prediction of the residual strength based on the SVM for practicing geotechnical engineers. Sensitivity analyses have been also performed to investigate the effects of different index properties on the residual strength of soil.

AB In this paper, we bring into the scheduling field a general learning effect model where the actual processing time of a job is not only a general function of the total actual processing times of the jobs already processed, but also a general function of the job's scheduled position. We show that the makespan minimization problem and the sum of the kth power of completion times minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time, respectively. We also show that the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem can be solved in polynomial time under certain conditions.

AB Leveraging machine learning has been proven as a promising avenue for addressing many practical circuit design and verification challenges. We demonstrate a novel active learning guided machine learning approach for characterizing circuit performance. When employed under the context of support vector machines, the proposed probabilistically weighted active learning approach is able to dramatically reduce the size of the training data, leading to significant reduction of the overall training cost. The proposed active learning approach is extended to the training of asymmetric support vector machine classifiers, which is further sped up by a global acceleration scheme. We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed techniques using three case studies: PLL lock-time verification, SRAM yield analysis and prediction of chip peak temperature using a limited number of on-chip temperature sensors.

AB Teaching methodology for industrial engineering must adapt and update its pedagogy by adopting innovative and dynamic approaches to training in state-of-the-art manufacturing technology. The development of virtual reality and computer simulation software has significantly improved the quality of education by raising learner motivation, commitment, and participation in the learning process. In university contexts characterised by large numbers of students, a hands-on approach to training in machine-tool operation on lathes and mills is unfeasible. Hence, the teaching methodology proposed involves the use of machine-tool simulators to undertake practical tasks in a virtual learning environment. The learning tasks focus on the main machine-tool components and their movements as well as on the principles and operations of machining in turning and milling processes performed on virtual machine where learners can acquire skills similar to those using traditional methodology, but require fewer resources and learning time spans.

AB This paper presents a machine learning (ML) based event detection and summarization system for soccer matches. The proposed system is composed of six phases. Firstly, in the pre-processing phase, the system segments the whole video stream into small video shots. Then, in the shot processing phase, it applies two types of classification to the video shots resulted from the pre-processing phase. Afterwards, in the replay detection phase, the system applies two machine learning algorithms, namely; support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN), for emphasizing important segments with logo appearance. Also, in the score board detection phase, the system uses both ML algorithms for detecting the caption region providing information about the score of the game. Subsequently, in the excitement event detection phase, the system uses k-means algorithm and Hough line transform for detecting vertical goal posts and Gabor filter for detecting goal net. Finally, in the logo-based event detection and summarization phase, the system highlights the most important events during the match. Experiments on real soccer videos demonstrate encouraging results. Compared to the performance results obtained using SVM classifier, the proposed system attained good NN-based performance results concerning recall ratio, however it attained poor NN-based performance results concerning precision ratio.

AB Accurate treatment of electron correlation in quantum chemistry requires solving the many-electron problem. If the nodal surface of amany-electron wave function is available even in an approximate form, the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC) approach from the family of quantum Monte Carlo methods can be successfully used for this purpose. The issue of description and classification of nodal surfaces of fermionic wave functions becomes central for understanding the basic properties of many-electron wave functions and for the control of accuracy and computational efficiency of FNDMC computations. In this work, we approach the problem of automatic classification of nodal pockets of many-electron wave functions. We formulate this problem as that of binary classification and apply a number of techniques from the machine learning literature. We apply these techniques on a range of atoms of light elements and demonstrate varying degrees of success. We observe that classifiers with relatively simple geometry perform poorly on the classification task; methods based on a random collection of tree-based classifiers appear to perform best. We conclude with thoughts on computational challenges and complexity associated with applying these techniques to heavier atoms.

The group setup time is assumed to follow a simple linear time-dependent deteriorating model. Two models of learning for the job processing time are examined in this study. We provided polynomial time solutions for the makespan minimization problems. We also showed that the total completion time minimization problems remain polynomially solvable under agreeable conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS
AB We present a new approach for constructing regression and classification models for interval-valued data. The risk functional is considered under a set of probability distributions, resulting from the application of a chosen inferential method to the data, such that the bounding distributions of the set depend on the regression and classification parameter. Two extreme ('pessimistic' and 'optimistic') strategies of decision making are presented. The method is applicable with many inferential methods and risk functionals. The general theory is presented together with the specific optimisation problems for several scenarios, including the extension of the support vector machine method for interval-valued data.

AB Most existing online algorithms in support vector machines (SVM) can only grow support vectors. This paper proposes an online error tolerance based support vector machine (ET-SVM) which not only grows but also prunes support vectors. Similar to least square support vector machines (LS-SVM), ET-SVM converts the original quadratic program (QP) in standard SVM into a group of easily solved linear equations. Different from LS-SVM, ET-SVM remains support vectors sparse and realizes a compact structure. Thus, ET-SVM can significantly reduce computational time while ensuring satisfactory learning accuracy. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we apply and evaluate a machine-learning-based system to Portuguese clause identification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first machine-learning-based approach to this task. The proposed system is based on Entropy Guided Transformation Learning. In order to train and evaluate the proposed system, we derive a clause annotated corpus from the Bosgue corpus of the Floresta Sinta(c)tica Project - an European and Brazilian Portuguese treebank. We include part-of-speech (POS) tags to the derived corpus by using an automatic state-of-the-art tagger. Additionally, we use a simple heuristic to derive a phrase-chunk-like (PCL) feature from phrases in the Bosque corpus. We train an extractor to this sub-task and use it to automatically include the PCL feature in the derived clause corpus. We use POS and PCL tags as input features in the proposed clause identifier. This system achieves a F-beta=1 of 73.90, when using the golden values of the PCL feature. When the automatic values are used, the system obtains F-beta=1 = 69.31. These are promising results for a first machine learning approach to Portuguese clause identification. Moreover, these results are achieved using a very simple PCL feature, which is generated by a PCL extractor developed with very little modeling effort.

AB At present, there is much variability between MALDI-TOF MS methodology for the characterization of bacteria through differences in e.g., sample preparation methods, matrix solutions, organic solvents, acquisition methods and data analysis methods. After evaluation of the existing methods, a standard protocol was developed to generate MALDI-TOF mass spectra obtained from a collection of reference strains belonging to the genera Leuconostoc. Fructobacillus and Lactococcus. Bacterial cells were harvested after 24 h of growth at 28 degrees C on the media MRS or TSA. Mass spectra were generated, using the CHCA matrix combined with a 50:48:2 acetonitrile:water:trifluoroacetic acid matrix solution, and analyzed by the cell smear method and the cell extract method. After a data preprocessing step, the resulting high quality data set was used for PCA, distance calculation and multi-dimensional scaling. Using these analyses, species-specific information in the MALDI-TOF mass spectra could be demonstrated. As a next step, the spectra, as well as the binary character set derived from these spectra, were successfully used for species identification within the genera Leuconostoc, Fructobacillus, and Lactococcus. Using MALDI-TOF MS identification libraries for Leuconostoc and Fructobacillus strains, 84% of the MALDI-TOF mass spectra were correctly identified at the species level. Similarly, the same analysis strategy within the genus Lactococcus resulted in 94% correct identifications, taking species and subspecies levels into consideration. Finally, two machine learning techniques were evaluated as alternative species identification tools. The two techniques, support vector machines and random forests, resulted in accuracies between 94% and 98% for the identification of Leuconostoc and Fructobacillus species, respectively.

AB Progresses in the field of biotechnology permitted the emergence of an effective screening technique, High Throughput Screening (HTS). In a typical HTS campaign, the main objective consists of the identification of active compounds, called hits. We discuss the possibility of using machine learning methods to predict experimental HTS measurements. Such a virtual HTS analysis will be based on the results of real HTS campaigns carried out with similar compound libraries and similar drug targets. In this way, we analyze an experimental HTS assay from McMaster Data Mining and Docking Competition (Elowe et al. 2005) by means of decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. First, we study separately the molecular and atomic descriptors in order to establish which of them provide a better discrimination. We present and discuss the results provided by machine learning methods in terms of identification of false positive and false negative hits.

AB Bayesian reasoning provides an ideal basis for representing and manipulating uncertain knowledge, with the result that many interesting algorithms in machine learning are based on Bayesian inference. In this paper, we use the Bayesian approach with one and two levels of inference to model the semisupervised learning problem and give its application to the successful kernel classifier support vector machine (SVM) and its variant least-squares SVM (LS-SVM). Taking advantage of Bayesian interpretation of LS-SVM, we develop a semisupervised learning algorithm for Bayesian LS-SVM using our approach based on two levels of inference. Experimental results on both artificial and real pattern recognition problems show the utility of our method.

AB We introduce a machine learning model to predict atomization energies of a diverse set of organic molecules, based on nuclear charges and atomic positions only. The problem of solving the molecular Schrodinger equation is mapped onto a nonlinear statistical regression problem of reduced complexity. Regression models are trained on and compared to atomization energies computed with hybrid density-functional theory. Cross validation over more than seven thousand organic molecules yields a mean absolute error of similar to 10 kcal/mol.

AB Patents represent the technological or inventive activity and output across different fields, regions, and time. The analysis of information from patents could be used to help focus efforts in research and the economy; however, the roles of the factors that can be extracted from patent records are still not entirely understood. To better understand the impact of these factors on patent value, machine learning techniques such as feature selection and classification are used to analyze patents in a sample industry, nanotechnology. Each nanotechnology patent was represented by a comprehensive set of numerical features that describe inventors, assignees, patent classification, and outgoing references. After careful design that included selection of the most relevant features, selection and optimization of the accuracy of classification models that aimed at finding most valuable (top-performing) patents, we used the generated models to analyze which factors allow to differentiate between the top-performing and the remaining nanotechnology patents. A few interesting findings surface as important such as the past performance of inventors and assignees, and the count of referenced patents.

AB Machine learning methods have always been promising in the science and engineering fields, and the use of these methods in chemistry and drug design has advanced especially since the 1990s. In this study, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces of phencyclidine-like (PCP-like) compounds are modeled and visualized in order to extract features that are useful in predicting binding affinities. In modeling, the Cartesian coordinates of MEP surface points are mapped onto a spherical self-organizing map (SSOM). The resulting maps are visualized using electrostatic potential (ESP) values. These values also provide features for a prediction system. Support vector machines and partial least-squares method are used for predicting binding affinities of compounds.

AB Recently, GPS car navigation became popular enough for a significant number of drivers in any large city to be able to potentially send their current GPS positions and velocities to a central traffic-managing server in real time. This data could be used to reconstruct a map of current traffic in the whole city and make predictions for the future, which would be valuable for traffic control, congestion analysis and prevention. The difficulty lying in the traffic reconstruction problem is that the number of cars equipped with a GPS transmitter is a small in comparison with the total number of cars in the road network. Information obtained from GPS transmitters is therefore rare and incomplete, raising the problem of approximating travel velocities from sparse information. In this context, the paper proposes approaches to solving two problems: (1) of reconstruction of routes of the individual cars in a street graph from a temporal stream of its coordinates and (2) of approximating the average velocity on a given street from irregular time series of instantaneous velocities of cars passing through that street. Determining the car's position in the road network is quite expensive computationally when done in a naive way, so we propose a method to speed up the car's localization based on the R-tree data structure [10]. Additionally, a resilient propagation neural network [13] is applied to approximate the average velocity on any edge of a street graph. Our methods were applied to one of the problems announced in the competition organized in June 2010 by Tom-Tom - a company producing automotive navigation systems [15]. The results of experiments show the capacity of our approach to make useful predictions.

AB The research described in this paper forms the backbone of a service that enables the faceted search experience of the Yahoo! search engine. We introduce an approach for a machine learned ranking of entity facets based on user click feedback and features extracted from three different ranking sources. The objective of the learned model is to predict the click-through rate on an entity facet. In an empirical evaluation we compare the performance of gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) against a linear combination of features on two different click feedback models using the raw click-through rate (CTR.), and click over expected clicks (COEC). The results show a significant improvement in ranking performance, in terms of discounted cumulated gain, when ranking entity facets with GBDT trained on the COEC model. Most notably this is true when evaluated against the CTR test set.

AB Next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to determine the collective genomes of microbial communities co-existing within diverse ecological environments. Varying species abundance, length and complexities within different communities, coupled with discovery of new species makes the problem of taxonomic assignment to short DNA sequence reads extremely challenging. We have developed a new sequence composition-based taxonomic classifier using extreme learning machines referred to as TAC-ELM for metagenomic analysis. TAC-ELM uses the framework of extreme learning machines to quickly and accurately learn the weights for a neural network model. The input features consist of GC content and oligonucleotides. TAC-ELM is evaluated on two metagenomic benchmarks with sequence read lengths reflecting the traditional and current sequencing technologies. Our empirical results indicate the strength of the developed approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art taxonomic classifiers in terms of accuracy and implementation complexity. We also perform experiments that evaluate the pervasive case within metagenome analysis, where a species may not have been previously sequenced or discovered and will not exist in the reference genome databases. TAC-ELM was also combined with BLAST to show improved classification results. Code and Supplementary Results: http://www.cs.gmu.edu/similar to mlbio/TAC-ELM (BSD License).

AB odern robots are not build to solve pre -determined tasks, rather they are designed to tackle a wider class of problems. Finding efficient control algorithms for a new problem within the class is not straightforward. Machine learning techniques, e.g., reinforcement learning (RL) proved to provide suitable methods in finding such control algorithms. Robotic control learning tasks share several common properties, thus, when selecting among RL methods one has to consider these properties. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art RL algorithms from the perspective of robotic control. We highlight their advantages and drawbacks in conjunction with robotic control, hereby, analyzing their feasibility in this context. Our results are supported by simulated pole balancing control experiments.

AB Hydraulic high strain rate materials testing machines are required to track a user-defined velocity profile during tensile or compression tests in the face of sudden large impact forces. Due to delays and limited bandwidth of the actuation system, causal feedback/feedforward controllers fail to compensate for these disturbances. This paper presents more suitable non-causal learning control strategies, which anticipate the impact and take corrective action in advance. Two control strategies are discussed. The first comprises an iterative algorithm, which calculates a command signal correction by passing the velocity error observed in the previous test through an inverse model linearized around the target velocity. In the second approach, a detailed nonlinear inverse model is used to obtain a command signal from demand motion and force data. It is concluded that the first method is superior if two or more iterations can be performed.

   machine learning; support vector machine
AB Protein homology prediction is a crucial step in template-based protein structure prediction. The functions that rank the proteins in a database according to their homologies to a query protein is the key to the success of protein structure prediction. In terms of information retrieval, such functions are called ranking functions, and are often constructed by machine learning approaches. Different from traditional machine learning problems, the feature vectors in the ranking-function learning problem are not identically and independently distributed, since they are calculated with regard to queries and may vary greatly in statistical characteristics from query to query. At present, few existing algorithms make use of the query-dependence to improve ranking performance. This paper proposes a query-adaptive ranking-function learning algorithm for protein homology prediction. Experiments with the support vector machine (SVM) used as the benchmark learner demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the ranking performance of SVMs in the protein homology prediction task.

AB The main idea of a priori machine learning is to apply a machine learning method on a machine learning problem itself. We call it "a priori" because the processed data set does not originate from any measurement or other observation. Machine learning which deals with any observation is called "posterior". The paper describes how posterior machine learning can be modified by a priori machine learning. A priori and posterior machine learning algorithms are proposed for artificial neural network training and are tested in the task of audio-visual phoneme classification.

AB We study non-convex optimization problems which appear in machine learning and statistics. Recently, convexity became an important feature to develop high-performance learning algorithms. On the other hand, non-convex optimization is also required in machine learning. In this paper, especially we deal with non-convex optimization problems on the Stiefel manifold. The Stiefel manifold consists of rectangular matrices, and many important problems in machine learning can be expressed in this framework. We compare some non-linear optimization methods which are applicable to machine learning algorithms.

AB This paper presents a machine learning approach to the study of translationese. The goal is to train a computer system to distinguish between translated and non-translated text, in order to determine the characteristic features that influence the classifiers. Several algorithms reach up to 97.62% success rate on a technical dataset. Moreover, the SVM classifier consistently reports a statistically significant improved accuracy when the learning system benefits from the addition of simplification features to the basic translational classifier system. Therefore, these findings may be considered an argument for the existence of the Simplification Universal.

AB Objective. We report on a classification approach using machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of postoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) requirement following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
   Background. FNBs are commonly performed for ACL reconstruction to control postoperative pain. Ideally, anesthesiologists would target preoperative FNB only to ACL reconstruction patients expected to experience severe postoperative pain. Perioperative factors associated with postoperative FNB placement following ACL reconstruction remain unclear, may differ among separate surgical facilities, and render such predictions difficult.
   Methods. We conducted a chart review of 349 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction at a single outpatient surgical facility. Standard perioperative data commonly available during routine preoperative examination were recorded. ML classifiers based on logistic regression, BayesNet, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, and alternating decision tree (ADTree) algorithms were then developed to predict which patients would require postoperative FNB.
   Results. Each of the ML algorithms outperformed traditional logistic regression using a very limited data set as measured by the area under the receiver operating curve, with ADTree achieving the highest score of 0.7 in the cross-validated sample. Logistic regression outperformed all other classifiers with regard to kappa statistics and percent correctly classified. All models were prone to overfitting in comparisons of training vs cross-validated samples.
   Conclusion. ML classifiers may offer improved predictive capabilities when analyzing medical data sets compared with traditional statistical methodologies in predicting severe postoperative pain requiring peripheral nerve block.

AB This work describes the potential of oil spill classification from optical satellite images, as investigated by applying different machine learning techniques to a dataset of more than 300 oil spill candidates, which have been detected from multi-spectral satellite sensors during the years 2008 and 2009, over the entire area of the Mediterranean Sea. A set of geometrical and grey level features from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) literature has been extracted from the regions of interest in order to characterize possible oil spills and feed the classification system. Results obtained by applying different machine learning classifiers to the dataset, and the achieved performance are discussed. In particular, as a first approach to oil spill classification, simple statistical classifiers and neural networks were used. Then, a more interpretable fuzzy rule-based classifier was employed, and performance evaluation was refined by exploiting Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Finally, since oil spill dataset collection happens incrementally, a suitable technique for online classification was proposed, encompassing at the same time cost-oriented classification, in order to allow for a dynamic change of the misclassification costs. This latter goal has been achieved by building an ensemble of cost-oriented, incremental and decremental support vector machines, exploiting the concept of the ROC convex hull.

TI Automatic Document Layout Analysis through Relational Machine Learning
SO LEARNING STRUCTURE AND SCHEMAS FROM DOCUMENTS
SE Studies in Computational Intelligence

DT Article; Book Chapter
ID PAGE SEGMENTATION
AB The current spread of digital documents raised the need of effective content-based retrieval techniques. Since manual indexing is infeasible and subjective, automatic techniques are the obvious solution. In particular, the ability of properly identifying and understanding a document's structure is crucial, in order to focus on the most significant components only. At a geometrical level, this task is known as Layout Analysis, and thoroughly studied in the literature. On suitable descriptions of the document layout, Machine Learning techniques can be applied to automatically infer models of classes of documents and of their components. Indeed, organizing the documents on the grounds of the knowledge they contain is fundamental for being able to correctly access them according to the user's needs.
   Thus, the quality of the layout analysis outcome biases the next understanding steps. Unfortunately, due to the variety of document styles and formats, the automatically found structure often needs to be manually adjusted. We propose the application of supervised Machine Learning techniques to infer correction rules to be applied to forthcoming documents. A first-order logic representation is suggested, because corrections often depend on the relationships of the wrong components with the surrounding ones. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous flow of documents, the learned models often need to be updated and refined, which calls for incremental abilities. The proposed technique, embedded in a prototypical version of the document processing system DOMINUS, using the incremental first-order logic learner INTHELEX, revealed good performance in real-world experiments.

Journal of Seismic Exploration, 21: 323-345. This paper proposes a method for solving 3D seismic data inversion problems for prediction of porosity in hydrocarbon reservoirs. An actual carbonate oil field in the south-western part of Iran was selected for this study. Taking real geological conditions into account, different synthetic models of reservoir were constructed for a range of viable porosity values. Seismic surveying was performed next on these models. From seismic response of the synthetic models, a large number of seismic attributes were identified as candidates for porosity estimation. Classes of attributes such as energy, instantaneous, and frequency attributes were included amongst others. Applying sensitivity analysis, the two most significant attributes were determined as Envelope Weighted Phase and Envelope Weighted Frequency, which were subsequently used in our machine learning algorithms. In particular, we used feed-forward artificial neural networks (FNN) and support vector regression machines (SVR) to develop relationships between the known synthetic attributes and synthetic porosity values in a given setting. The FNN consists of six neurons in a single hidden layer and the SVR method uses a Gaussian radial basis function. Compared with real values from the well data, we observed that SVM outperforms FNN due to its better handling of noise and model complexity.

AB A hybrid intelligent (HI) model, comprising a data preprocessing component and a HI forecaster, is developed to tackle the medium-term fashion sales forecasting problem. The HI forecaster firstly adopts a novel learning algorithm-based neural network to generate initial sales forecasts and then uses a heuristic fine-tuning process to obtain more accurate forecasts based on the initial ones. The learning algorithm integrates an improved harmony search algorithm and an extreme learning machine to improve the network generalization performance. Extensive experiments based on real fashion retail data and public benchmark datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model is much superior to traditional ARIMA models and two recently developed neural network models for fashion sales forecasting.

AB Objective: To develop a high performance machine learning (ML) approach for predicting the age and consequently the state of brain development of infants, based on their event related potentials (ERPs) in response to an auditory stimulus.
   Methods: The ERP responses of twenty-nine 6-month-olds, nineteen 12-month-olds and 10 adults to an auditory stimulus were derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The most relevant wavelet coefficients corresponding to the first-and second-order moment sequences of the ERP signals were then identified using a feature selection scheme that made no a priori assumptions about the features of interest. These features are then fed into a classifier for determination of age group.
   Results: We verified that ERP data could yield features that discriminate the age group of individual subjects with high reliability. A low dimensional representation of the selected feature vectors show significant clustering behavior corresponding to the subject age group. The performance of the proposed age group prediction scheme was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation method and found to exceed 90% accuracy.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that ERP responses to an acoustic stimulus can be used to predict the age and consequently the state of brain development of infants.
   Significance: This study is of fundamental scientific significance in demonstrating that a machine classification algorithm with no a priori assumptions can classify ERP responses according to age and with further work, potentially provide useful clues in the understanding of the development of the human brain. A potential clinical use for the proposed methodology is the identification of developmental delay: an abnormal condition may be suspected if the age estimated by the proposed technique is significantly less than the chronological age of the subject.

AB In this paper, we introduce a soft vector quantization scheme with inverse power-function distribution, and analytically derive an upper bound of the resulting quantization noise energy in comparison to that of typical (hard-deciding) vector quantization.
   We also discuss the positive impact of this kind of soft vector quantization on the performance of machine-learning systems that include one or more vector quantization modules. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence on the advantage of avoiding over-fitting and boosting the robustness of such systems in the presence of considerable parasitic variance; e.g. noise, in the runtime inputs. The experiments have been conducted with two versions of one of the best reported discrete HMM-based Arabic OCR systems; one version deploying hard vector quantization and the other deploying our herein presented soft vector quantization. Test samples of real-life scanned pages are used to challenge both versions; hence the recognition error margins are compared.

AB In the future of surgery, tele-operated robotic assistants will offer the possibility of performing certain commonly occurring tasks autonomously. Using a natural division of tasks into subtasks, we propose a novel surgical Human-Machine Collaborative (HMC) system in which portions of a surgical task are performed autonomously under complete surgeon's control, and other portions manually. Our system automatically identifies the completion of a manual subtask, seamlessly executes the next automated task, and then returns control back to the surgeon. Our approach is based on learning from demonstration. It uses Hidden Markov Models for the recognition of task completion and temporal curve averaging for learning the executed motions. We demonstrate our approach using a da Vinci tele-surgical robot. We show on two illustrative tasks where such human-machine collaboration is intuitive that automated control improves the usage of the master manipulator workspace. Because such a system does not limit the traditional use of the robot, but merely enhances its capabilities while leaving full control to the surgeon, it provides a safe and acceptable solution for surgical performance enhancement.

AB In the metropolitan region, most congestion or traffic jams are caused by the uneven distribution of traffic flow that creates bottleneck points where the traffic volume exceeds the road capacity. Additionally, unexpected incidents are the next most probable cause of these bottleneck regions. Moreover, most drivers are driving based on their empirical experience without awareness of real-time traffic situations. This unintelligent traffic behavior can make the congestion problem worse. Prediction based route guidance systems show great improvements in solving the inefficient diversion strategy problem by estimating future travel time when calculating accurate travel time is difficult. However, performances of machine learning based prediction models that are based on the historical data set degrade sharply during a congestion situation. This paper develops a new navigation system for reducing travel time of an individual driver and distributing the flow of urban traffic efficiently in order to reduce the occurrence of congestion. Compared with previous route guidance systems, the results reveal that our system, applying the advanced multi-lane prediction based real-time fastest path (AMPRFP) algorithm, can significantly reduce the travel time especially when drivers travel in a complex route environment and face frequent congestion problems. Unlike the previous system,(1) it can be applied either for single lane or multi-lane urban traffic networks where the reason for congestion is significantly complex. We also demonstrate the advantages of this system and verify the results using real highway traffic data and a synthetic experiment.

AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of genetic mutations associated with various diseases. The inclusion of SNPs from GWAS has shown some benefits of improving traditional risk prediction. However, the contribution of genomic profiling to disease classification is unclear yet. Here we present a systematic analysis of the effects of genomic profiling by machine learning. Our study suggests that the odds ratio plays an essential role in the disease classification. In order to explain the majority of variations in a typical case/control study, at least 100 SNPs with effect size of 1.5 and 20% frequency have to be included. The result indicates that more disease-related variants are yet to be identified to obtain meaningful genomic profiling. SVM is capable to recognize the classification pattern with relatively less samples and more resistant to noises.

DE Local learning; multiple kernel learning; support vector machines
ID SUPPORT; MACHINES
AB Localized multiple kernel learning (LMKL) is an attractive strategy for combining multiple heterogeneous features in terms of their discriminative power for each individual sample. However, models excessively fitting to a specific sample would obstacle the extension to unseen data, while a more general form is often insufficient for diverse locality characterization. Hence, both learning sample-specific localmodels for each training datum and extending the learned models to unseen test data should be equally addressed in designing LMKL algorithm. In this paper, for an integrative solution, we propose a probability confidence kernel (PCK), which measures per-sample similarity with respect to probabilistic-prediction-based class attribute: The class attribute similarity complements the spatial-similarity-based base kernels for more reasonable locality characterization, and the predefined form of involved class probability density function facilitates the extension to the whole input space and ensures its statistical meaning. Incorporating PCK into support-vector-machine-based LMKL framework, we propose a new PCK-LMKL with arbitrary l(p)-norm constraint implied in the definition of PCKs, where both the parameters in PCK and the final classifier can be efficiently optimized in a joint manner. Evaluations of PCK-LMKL on both benchmark machine learning data sets (ten University of California Irvine (UCI) data sets) and challenging computer vision data sets (15-scene data set and Caltech-101 data set) have shown to achieve state-of-the-art performances.

AB The Bayesian approach to machine learning amounts to inferring posterior distributions of random variables from a probabilistic model of how the variables are related (that is, a prior distribution) and a set of observations of variables. There is a trend in machine learning towards expressing Bayesian models as probabilistic programs. As a foundation for this kind of programming, we propose a core functional calculus with primitives for sampling prior distributions and observing variables. We define combinators for measure transformers, based on theorems in measure theory, and use these to give a rigorous semantics to our core calculus. The original features of our semantics include its support for discrete, continuous, and hybrid measures, and, in particular, for observations of zero-probability events. We compile our core language to a small imperative language that has a straightforward semantics via factor graphs, data structures that enable many efficient inference algorithms. We use an existing inference engine for efficient approximate inference of posterior marginal distributions, treating thousands of observations per second for large instances of realistic models.

AB Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Echo State Networks (ESNs) represent promising alternatives in time series forecasting in view of their intrinsic trade-off between performance and mathematical tractability. Both approaches share a key feature: their supervised parameter adaptation is restricted to the output layer, the remaining synaptic weights being chosen according to a priori unsupervised schemes. This work performs a comparative investigation regarding the performances of a classic ELM and ESNs in the context of the prediction of monthly seasonal streamflow series associated with Brazilian hydroelectric plants. With respect to the ESN, two possible reservoir design approaches are tested, as well as the novel architecture of Boccato et al., which is characterized by the use a Volterra filter and PCA in the readout. Additionally, a MLP is included to establish a base for comparison. Results show the relevance of these architectures in modeling seasonal streamflow series.

AB Support vector machines are state-of-the-art pattern recognition algorithms that are well founded in optimization and generalization theory but not obviously applicable to the brain. This paper presents Bio-SVM, a biologically feasible support vector machine. An unstable associative memory oscillates between support vectors and interacts with a feed-forward classification pathway. Kernel neurons blend support vectors and sensory input. Downstream temporal integration generates the classification. Instant learning of surprising events and off-line tuning of support vector weights trains the system. Emotion-based learning, forgetting trivia, sleep and brain oscillations are phenomena that agree with the Bio-SVM model. A mapping to the olfactory system is suggested. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Known are many different capacity measures for learning machines like: Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, covering numbers or fat dimension. In this paper we present experimental results of sample complexity estimation, taking into account rather simple learning machines linear in parameters. We show that, sample complexity can be quite different even for learning machines having the same VC-dimension. Moreover, independently from the capacity of a learning machine, the distribution of data is also significant. Experimental results are compared with known theoretical results for sample complexity and generalization bounds.

ID MARGIN
AB The eigenspectrum of a graph Laplacian encodes smoothness information over the graph. A natural approach to learning involves transforming the spectrum of a graph Laplacian to obtain a kernel. While manual exploration of the spectrum is conceivable, non-parametric learning methods that adjust the Laplacian's spectrum promise better performance. For instance, adjusting the graph Laplacian using kernel target alignment (KTA) yields better performance when an SVM is trained on the resulting kernel. KTA relies on a simple surrogate criterion to choose the kernel; the obtained kernel is then fed to a large margin classification algorithm. In this paper, we propose novel formulations that jointly optimize relative margin and the spectrum of a kernel defined via Laplacian eigenmaps. The large relative margin case is in fact a strict generalization of the large margin case. The proposed methods show significant empirical advantage over numerous other competing methods.

AB There is an increasing need for the rapid safety assessment of chemicals by both industries and regulatory agencies throughout the world. In silico techniques are practical alternatives in the environmental hazard assessment. It is especially true to address the persistence, bioaccumulative and toxicity potentials of organic chemicals. Tetrahymena pyriformis toxicity is often used as a toxic endpoint. In this study, 1571 diverse unique chemicals were collected from the literature and composed of the largest diverse data set for T. pyriformis toxicity. Classification predictive models of T. pyriformis toxicity were developed by substructure pattern recognition and different machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbors and random forest. The results of a 5-fold cross-validation showed that the SVM method performed better than other algorithms. The overall predictive accuracies of the SVM classification model with radial basis functions kernel was 92.2% for the 5-fold cross-validation and 92.6% for the external validation set, respectively. Furthermore, several representative substructure patterns for characterizing T. pyriformis toxicity were also identified via the information gain analysis methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The importance of the ready times can be found in Wafer fabrication with the presence of unequal ready times. It is sometimes advantageous to form a non-full batch, while in other situations it is a better strategy to wait for future job arrivals in order to increase the fullness of the batch. On the other hand, there is a significant involvement of humans in scheduling environments; the amount of learning activities is high. Hence it seems to be reasonable to consider learning in scheduling environments. However, research with learning and release times is relatively unexplored. Motivated by this observation, this paper deals with a single-machine problem with the learning effect and release times where the objective is to minimize the makespan. This paper proposes a branch-and-bound algorithm and three two-stage heuristic algorithms for the problem. The computational experiments show that the branch-and-bound algorithm can solve instances up to 25 jobs, and the best one with the average error percentage of the proposed heuristics is less than 0.05%.

AB In recent years, corpus based approaches to machine translation have become predominant, with Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) being the most actively progressing area. Success of these approaches depends on the availability of parallel corpora. In this paper we propose Active Crowd Translation (ACT), a new paradigm where active learning and crowd-sourcing come together to enable automatic translation for low-resource language pairs. Active learning aims at reducing cost of label acquisition by prioritizing the most informative data for annotation, while crowd-sourcing reduces cost by using the power of the crowds to make do for the lack of expensive language experts. We experiment and compare our active learning strategies with strong baselines and see significant improvements in translation quality. Similarly, our experiments with crowd-sourcing on Mechanical Turk have shown that it is possible to create parallel corpora using non-experts and with sufficient quality assurance, a translation system that is trained using this corpus approaches expert quality.

AB This paper discusses on the cooperation and the learning processes to increase the autonomy of a human-machine system or an artificial or human agent. The autonomy is defined as the capacity for a system or an agent to fend alone. It is described in terms of competences and the limits of these competences. Cooperation and learning aim then at increasing the competences or managing the system limits. The management of the autonomy is detailed through different structures of cooperation. It concerns the sharing control between systems or between agents in order to recover their limits. Different classes of learning processes are proposed: the mimicry-based approaches, the dysfunction-based ones, and the wait-and-see-based ones. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are usually designed integrating cooperation characteristics. Two case studies about the use of cooperative ADAS are then proposed. They are hypothetical scenarios that are discussed to introduce possible future ADAS perspective implementing competences such as learning or cooperative learning.

AB Various methods have been proposed to downscale the coarse resolution general circulation model (GCM) climatological variables to the fine-scale regional variables; however, fewer studies have been focused on the selection of GCM predictors. Additionally, the results obtained from one downscaling technique may not be robust and the uncertainties related to the downscaling scheme are not realized. To address these issues, the writers employed independent component analysis (ICA) for predictor selection that determines spatially independent GCM variables. Cross-validation of the independent components is employed to find the predictor combination that describes the regional precipitation over the upper Willamette basin with minimum error. These climate variables, along with the observed precipitation, are used to calibrate three downscaling models: multilinear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The presented method incorporates several GCM grids in the downscaling process that allows considering more predictors in the model calibration and removes the predictors correlation and dependence by ICA. Also, the study uses several downscaling techniques to develop an ensemble of precipitation time series that can be used in hydrologic climate impact assessment. The performance assessment of the results indicates that the procedure is successful in choosing the predictors for downscaling the GCM data both in monthly and seasonal timescales. The study shows that by choosing proper predictors the MLR model is an efficient method for precipitation downscaling. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000355.

TI Active machine learning for transmembrane helix prediction
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS

DT Article
ID MEMBRANE; EXPRESSION; TOPOLOGY; PROTEINS
AB Background: About 30% of genes code for membrane proteins, which are involved in a wide variety of crucial biological functions. Despite their importance, experimentally determined structures correspond to only about 1.7% of protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank due to the difficulty in crystallizing membrane proteins. Algorithms that can identify proteins whose high-resolution structure can aid in predicting the structure of many previously unresolved proteins are therefore of potentially high value. Active machine learning is a supervised machine learning approach which is suitable for this domain where there are a large number of sequences but only very few have known corresponding structures. In essence, active learning seeks to identify proteins whose structure, if revealed experimentally, is maximally predictive of others.
   Results: An active learning approach is presented for selection of a minimal set of proteins whose structures can aid in the determination of transmembrane helices for the remaining proteins. TMpro, an algorithm for high accuracy TM helix prediction we previously developed, is coupled with active learning. We show that with a well-designed selection procedure, high accuracy can be achieved with only few proteins. TMpro, trained with a single protein achieved an F-score of 94% on benchmark evaluation and 91% on MPtopo dataset, which correspond to the state-of-the-art accuracies on TM helix prediction that are achieved usually by training with over 100 training proteins.
   Conclusion: Active learning is suitable for bioinformatics applications, where manually characterized data are not a comprehensive representation of all possible data, and in fact can be a very sparse subset thereof. It aids in selection of data instances which when characterized experimentally can improve the accuracy of computational characterization of remaining raw data. The results presented here also demonstrate that the feature extraction method of TMpro is well designed, achieving a very good separation between TM and non TM segments.

AB This paper presents a machine learning classifier algorithm based on MOGA (Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm), which applies the information entropy theory to optimize the MOGA and then can be used to discretize the continuous attributes. According to the practical problems, the fitness vector can be constructed by judging multi-objective functions to find the Pareto optimal solutions. Combining the classic set theories with the two relationships, i.e. coverage and contradictory, between chromosomes, more reasonable selection rules can be worked out to delete the redundant chromosomes and get more efficient classification rules. The new algorithm was applied to Iris and Wine dataset from UCI. By comparison, the algorithm in this paper has higher classification accuracy than KNN, C4.5 and NaiveBayes.

AB Encouraged by a rise of reciprocal interest between the machine learning and neuroscience communities, several recent studies have demonstrated the explanatory power of statistical learning techniques for the analysis of neural data. In order to facilitate a wider adoption of these methods, neuroscientific research needs to ensure a maximum of transparency to allow for comprehensive evaluation of the employed procedures. We argue that such transparency requires "neuroscience-aware" technology for the performance of multivariate pattern analyses of neural data that can be documented in a comprehensive, yet comprehensible way. Recently, we introduced PyMVPA, a specialized Python framework for machine learning based data analysis that addresses this demand. Here, we review its features and applicability to various neural data modalities.

AB To improve product quality and productivity, one of the most critical factors for most manufacturers lies in quickly identifying root causes in machining process during ramp-up and production time. Though multivariate statistical process monitoring techniques using control charts have been successfully used to detect anomalies in machining processes, they cannot provide guidelines to identify and isolate root causes. One novel robust approach for root causes identification (RCI) in machining process using hybrid learning algorithm and engineering-driven rules is developed in this study. Firstly, off-line pattern match relationships between fixture fault patterns and part variation motion patterns are derived. Then, a hybrid learning algorithm is explored for identifying the part variation motion patterns. An unknown root cause is identified and isolated using the output of hybrid learning algorithm and engineering-driven rules. Finally, the data from the real-world cylinder head of engine machining processes are collected to validate the developed approach. The results indicate that the developed approach can perform effectively for identifying root causes of fixture in machining processes. All of the analysis from this study provides guidelines in developing root causes identification systems based on hybrid learning algorithm and engineering knowledge.

AB Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a useful tool for improving system energy efficiency, especially in multi-core chips where energy is more of a limiting factor. Per-core DVFS, where cores can independently scale their voltages and frequencies, is particularly effective. We present a DVFS policy using machine learning, which learns the best frequency choices for a machine as a decision tree.
   Machine learning is used to predict the frequency which will minimize the expected energy per user-instruction (epui) or energy per (user-instruction)2 (epui2). While each core independently sets its frequency and voltage, a core is sensitive to other cores' frequency settings. Also, we examine the viability of using only partial training to train our policy, rather than full profiling for each program.
   We evaluate our policy on a 16-core machine running multiprogrammed, multithreaded benchmarks from the PARSEC benchmark suite against a baseline fixed frequency as well as a recently-proposed greedy policy. For 1ms DVFS intervals, our technique improves system epui2 by 14.4% over the baseline no-DVFS policy and 11.3% on average over the greedy policy.

AB This paper suggests a novel method named DF-LS-SVM, which is based on least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) regression combined with data fusion (DF) to enhance the ability to extract characteristic information and improve the quality of the regression. Simultaneous differential pulse voltammetric multicomponent determination of o-nitrophenol, m-nitrophenol and p-nitropheno was conducted for the first time by using the proposed method. Data fusion is a technique that seamlessly integrates information from disparate sources to produce a single model or decision. The LS-SVM technique allow for learning a high -dimensional feature with fewer training data, and to reducing the computational complexity by only requiring the solution of a set of linear equations instead of a quadratic programming problem. Experimental results showed that the DF-LS-SVM method was successful for simultaneous multicomponent determination even when severe overlap of voltammograms existed. The DF-LS-SVM method is an attractive and promising hybrid approach that combines the best properties of the two techniques.

AB Within the complex and competitive semiconductor manufacturing industry, lot cycle time (CT) remains one of the key performance indicators. Its reduction is of strategic importance as it contributes to cost decreasing, time-to-market shortening, faster fault detection, achieving throughput targets, and improving production-resource scheduling. To reduce CT, we suggest and investigate a data-driven approach that identifies key factors and predicts their impact on CT. In our novel approach, we first identify the most influential factors using conditional mutual information maximization, and then apply the selective naive Bayesian classifier (SNBC) for further selection of a minimal, most discriminative key-factor set for CT prediction. Applied to a data set representing a simulated fab, our SNBC-based approach improves the accuracy of CT prediction in nearly 40% while narrowing the list of factors from 182 to 20. It shows comparable accuracy to those of other machine learning and statistical models, such as a decision tree, a neural network, and multinomial logistic regression. Compared to them, our approach also demonstrates simplicity and interpretability, as well as speedy and efficient model training. This approach could be implemented relatively easily in the fab promoting new insights to the process of wafer fabrication.

AB In this paper we introduce a novel classification framework that is based on the combination of the support vector machine classifier and the graph embedding framework. In particular we propose the substitution of the support vector machine kernel with sub-space or sub-manifold kernels, that are constructed based on the graph embedding framework. Our technique combines the very good generalization ability of the support vector machine classifier with the flexibility of the graph embedding framework resulting in improved classification performance. The attained experimental results on several benchmark and real-life data sets, further support our claim of improved classification performance.

AB We describe the "Shared Task on Applying Machine Learning Techniques to Optimise the Division of Labour in Hybrid Machine Translation" (ML4HMT) which aims to foster research on improved system combination approaches for machine translation (MT). Participants of the challenge are requested to build hybrid translations by combining the output of several MT systems of different types. We first describe the ML4HMT corpus used in the shared task, then explain the XLIFF-based annotation format we have designed for it, and briefly summarize the participating systems. Using both automated metrics scores and extensive manual evaluation, we discuss the individual performance of the various systems. An interesting result from the shared task is the fact that we were able to observe different systems winning according to the automated metrics scores when compared to the results from the manual evaluation. We conclude by summarising the first edition of the challenge and by giving an outlook to future work.

AB In this paper, we propose an integrated Gene normaliser (GNer) to assign a unique database identifier for each recognised gene mention in biological literature. The GNer combines Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and some rule-base components. First, we construct a dictionary from EntrezGene and BioThesaurus. Then we reduce variations and ambiguities of synonyms based on a designed pre-processor. Finally, a SVM-based disambiguation filter is developed to eliminate the ambiguity of exact matching. From the experimental results, the proposed GNer can achieve a fairly good performance, which can achieve the precision 80.5%, the recall 86.4% and the F-beta=1 measure 83.4.

AB The accuracy of the secondary structure element (SSE) identification from volumetric protein density maps is critical for de-novo backbone structure derivation in electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM). It is still challenging to detect the SSE automatically and accurately from the density maps at medium resolutions (similar to 510 angstrom). We present a machine learning approach, SSELearner, to automatically identify helices and beta-sheets by using the knowledge from existing volumetric maps in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. We tested our approach using 10 simulated density maps. The averaged specificity and sensitivity for the helix detection are 94.9% and 95.8%, respectively, and those for the beta-sheet detection are 86.7% and 96.4%, respectively. We have developed a secondary structure annotator, SSID, to predict the helices and beta-strands from the backbone Ca trace. With the help of SSID, we tested our SSELearner using 13 experimentally derived cryo-EM density maps. The machine learning approach shows the specificity and sensitivity of 91.8% and 74.5%, respectively, for the helix detection and 85.2% and 86.5% respectively for the beta-sheet detection in cryoEM maps of Electron Microscopy Data Bank. The reduced detection accuracy reveals the challenges in SSE detection when the cryoEM maps are used instead of the simulated maps. Our results suggest that it is effective to use one cryoEM map for learning to detect the SSE in another cryoEM map of similar quality. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 97: 698708, 2012.

AB We present morphological classifications obtained using machine learning for objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR6 that have been classified by Galaxy Zoo into three classes, namely early types, spirals and point sources/artefacts. An artificial neural network is trained on a subset of objects classified by the human eye, and we test whether the machine-learning algorithm can reproduce the human classifications for the rest of the sample. We find that the success of the neural network in matching the human classifications depends crucially on the set of input parameters chosen for the machine-learning algorithm. The colours and parameters associated with profile fitting are reasonable in separating the objects into three classes. However, these results are considerably improved when adding adaptive shape parameters as well as concentration and texture. The adaptive moments, concentration and texture parameters alone cannot distinguish between early type galaxies and the point sources/artefacts. Using a set of 12 parameters, the neural network is able to reproduce the human classifications to better than 90 per cent for all three morphological classes. We find that using a training set that is incomplete in magnitude does not degrade our results given our particular choice of the input parameters to the network. We conclude that it is promising to use machine-learning algorithms to perform morphological classification for the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys and that the Galaxy Zoo catalogue provides an invaluable training set for such purposes.

ID DETERIORATING JOBS
AB In this article, we consider the single-machine scheduling problem with past-sequence-dependent (p-s-d) setup times and a learning effect. The setup times are proportional to the length of jobs that are already scheduled; i.e. p-s-d setup times. The learning effect reduces the actual processing time of a job because the workers are involved in doing the same job or activity repeatedly. Hence, the processing time of a job depends on its position in the sequence. In this study, we consider the total absolute difference in completion times (TADC) as the objective function. This problem is denoted as 1/LE, (Spsd)/TADC in Kuo and Yang (2007) ('Single Machine Scheduling with Past-sequence-dependent Setup Times and Learning Effects', Information Processing Letters, 102, 22-26). There are two parameters a and b denoting constant learning index and normalising index, respectively. A parametric analysis of b on the 1/LE, (Spsd)/TADC problem for a given value of a is applied in this study. In addition, a computational algorithm is also developed to obtain the number of optimal sequences and the range of b in which each of the sequences is optimal, for a given value of a. We derive two bounds b* for the normalising constant b and a* for the learning index a. We also show that, when a < a* or b > b*, the optimal sequence is obtained by arranging the longest job in the first position and the rest of the jobs in short processing time order.

AB Machine learning methods, like random forest (RF), have shown their superior performance in various disciplines, but have not been previously applied to the spatial interpolation of environmental variables. In this study, we compared the performance of 23 methods, including RF, support vector machine (SVM), ordinary kriging (OK), inverse distance squared (IDS), and their combinations (i.e., RFOK, RFIDS, SVMOK and SVMIDS), using mud content samples in the southwest Australian margin. We also tested the sensitivity of the combined methods to input variables and the accuracy of averaging predictions of the most accurate methods. The accuracy of the methods was assessed using a 10-fold cross-validation. The spatial patterns of the predictions of the most accurate methods were also visually examined for their validity. This study confirmed the effectiveness of RF, in particular its combination with OK or IDS, and also confirmed the sensitivity of RF and its combined methods to the input variables. Averaging the predictions of the most accurate methods showed no significant improvement in the predictive accuracy. Visual examination proved to be an essential step in assessing the spatial predictions. This study has opened an alternative source of methods for spatial interpolation of environmental properties.

AB The backbone of the information age is digital information which may be searched, accessed, and transferred instantaneously. Therefore the digitization of paper documents is extremely interesting. This chapter describes approaches for document structure recognition detecting the hierarchy of physical components in images of documents, such as pages, paragraphs, and figures, and transforms this into a hierarchy of logical components, such as titles, authors, and sections. This structural information improves readability and is useful for indexing and retrieving information contained in documents. First we present a rule-based system segmenting the document image and estimating the logical role of these zones. It is extensively used for processing newspaper collections showing world-class performance. In the second part we introduce several machine learning approaches exploring large numbers of interrelated features. They can be adapted to geometrical models of the document structure, which may be set up as a linear sequence or a general graph. These advanced models require far more computational resources but show a better performance than simpler alternatives and might be used in future.

AB Automated essay scoring is the computer techniques and algorithms that evaluate and score essays automatically. Compared with human rater, automated essay scoring has the advantage of fairness, less human resource cost and timely feedback. In previous work, automated essay scoring is regarded as a classification or regression problem. Machine learning techniques such as K-nearest-neighbor (KNN), multiple linear regression have been applied to solve this problem. In this paper, we regard this problem as a ranking problem and apply a new machine learning method, learning to rank, to solve this problem. We will introduce detailed steps about how to apply learning to rank to automated essay scoring, such as feature extraction, scoring. Experiments in this paper show that learning to rank outperforms other classical machine learning techniques in automated essay scoring.

AB This paper presents a performance enhancement scheme for the recently developed extreme learning machine (ELM) for multi-category sparse data classification problems. ELM is a single hidden layer neural network with good generalization capabilities and extremely fast learning capacity. In ELM, the input weights are randomly chosen and the output weights are analytically calculated. The generalization performance of the ELM algorithm for sparse data classification problem depends critically on three free parameters. They are, the number of hidden neurons, the input weights and the bias values which need to be optimally chosen. Selection of these parameters for the best performance of ELM involves a complex optimization problem.
   In this paper, we present a new, real-coded genetic algorithm approach called 'RCGA-ELM' to select the optimal number of hidden neurons, input weights and bias values which results in better performance. Two new genetic operators called 'network based operator' and 'weight based operator' are proposed to find a compact network with higher generalization performance. We also present an alternate and less computationally intensive approach called 'sparse-ELM'. Sparse-ELM searches for the best parameters of ELM using K-fold validation. A multi-class human cancer classification problem using micro-array gene expression data (which is sparse), is used for evaluating the performance of the two schemes. Results indicate that the proposed RCGA-ELM and sparse-ELM significantly improve ELM performance for sparse multi-category classification problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a system for the early automatic recognition of health problems that manifest themselves in distinctive form of gait. Purpose of the system is to prolong the autonomous living of the elderly at home. When the system identifies a health problem, it automatically notifies a physician and provides an explanation of the automatic diagnosis. The gait of the elderly user is captured using a motion-capture system, which consists of body-worn tags and wall-mounted sensors. The positions of the tags are acquired by the sensors and the resulting time series of position coordinates are analyzed with machine-learning algorithms in order to recognize a specific health problem. Novel semantic features based on medical knowledge for training a machine-learning classifier are proposed in this paper. The classifier classifies the user's gait into: 1) normal, 2) with hemiplegia, 3) with Parkinson's disease, 4) with pain in the back and 5) with pain in the leg. The studies of 1) the feasibility of automatic recognition and 2) the impact of tag placement and noise level on the accuracy of the recognition of health problems are presented. The experimental results of the first study (12 tags, no noise) showed that the k-nearest neighbors and neural network algorithms achieved classification accuracies of 100%. The experimental results of the second study showed that classification accuracy of over 99% is achievable using several machine-learning algorithms and 8 or more tags with up to 15 mm standard deviation of noise. The results show that the proposed approach achieves high classification accuracy and can be used as a guide for further studies in the increasingly important area of Ambient Assisted Living. Since the system uses semantic features and an artificial-intelligence approach to interpret the health state, provides a natural explanation of the hypothesis and is embedded in the domestic environment of the elderly person; it is an example of the semantic ambient media for Ambient Assisted Living.

DE transfer learning; multitask learning; regularization
AB The success of regularized risk minimization approaches to classification with linear models depends crucially on the selection of a regularization term that matches with the learning task at hand. If the necessary domain expertise is rare or hard to formalize, it may be difficult to find a good regularizer. On the other hand, if plenty of related or similar data is available, it is a natural approach to adjust the regularizer for the new learning problem based on the characteristics of the related data. In this paper, we study the problem of obtaining good parameter values for a l(2)-style regularizer with feature weights. We analytically investigate a moment-based method to obtain good values and give uniform convergence bounds for the prediction error on the target learning task. An empirical study shows that the approach can improve predictive accuracy considerably in the application domain of text classification.

DE Machine learning; Data mining; Instance selection; Multi-agent system
AB Instance selection in the supervised machine learning, often referred to as the data reduction, aims at deciding which instances from the training set should be retained for further use during the learning process. Instance selection can result in increased capabilities and generalization properties of the learning model, shorter time of the learning process, or it can help in scaling up to large data sources. The paper proposes a cluster-based instance selection approach with the learning process executed by the team of agents and discusses its four variants. The basic assumption is that instance selection is carried out after the training data have been grouped into clusters. To validate the proposed approach and to investigate the influence of the clustering method used on the quality of the classification, the computational experiment has been carried out.

AB Predicting the effects of the blood thinner warfarin is very difficult because of its long half-life, interaction with drugs and food, and because every patient has a unique response to a given dose. Previous attempts to use machine learning have shown that no individual learner can accurately predict the drug's effect for all patients. In this paper we present our exploration of this problem using ensemble methods. The resulting system utilizes multiple ML algorithms and input parameters to make multiple predictions, which are then scrutinized by the doctor. Our results indicate that this approach may be a workable solution to the problem of automated warfarin prescription.

AB This paper studies the task of learning transformation models for ranking problems, ordinal regression and survival analysis. The present contribution describes a machine learning approach termed MINLIP. The key insight is to relate ranking criteria as the Area Under the Curve to monotone transformation functions. Consequently, the notion of a Lipschitz smoothness constant is found to be useful for complexity control for learning transformation models, much in a similar vein as the 'margin' is for Support Vector Machines for classification. The use of this model structure in the context of high dimensional data, as well as for estimating non-linear, and additive models based on primal-dual kernel machines, and for sparse models is indicated. Given n observations, the present method solves a quadratic program existing of O(n) constraints and O(n) unknowns, where most existing risk minimization approaches to ranking problems typically result in algorithms with O(n(2)) constraints or unknowns. We specify the MINLIP method for three different cases: the first one concerns the preference learning problem. Secondly it is specified how to adapt the method to ordinal regression with a finite set of ordered outcomes. Finally, it is shown how the method can be used in the context of survival analysis where one models failure times, typically subject to censoring. The current approach is found to be particularly useful in this context as it can handle, in contrast with the standard statistical model for analyzing survival data, all types of censoring in a straightforward way, and because of the explicit relation with the Proportional Hazard and Accelerated Failure Time models. The advantage of the current method is illustrated on different benchmark data sets, as well as for estimating a model for cancer survival based on different micro-array and clinical data sets.

AB In this study Active Learning Method (ALM) as a novel fuzzy modeling approach is compared with optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) using simple Genetic Algorithm (GA), as a well known data-driven model for long term simulation of daily streamflow in Karoon River. The daily discharge data from 1991 to 1996 and from 1996 to 1999 were utilized for training and testing of the models, respectively. Values of the Nash-Sutcliffe, Bias, R-2, MPAE and PTVE of ALM model with 16 fuzzy rules were 0.81, 5.5 m(3) s(-1), 0.81, 12.9%, and 1.9%, respectively. Following the same order of parameters, these criteria for optimized SVM model were 0.8, -10.7 m(3) s(-1), 0.81, 7.3%, and -3.6%, respectively. The results show appropriate and acceptable simulation by ALM and optimized SVM. Optimized SVM is a well-known method for runoff simulation and its capabilities have been demonstrated. Therefore, the similarity between ALM and optimized SVM results imply the ability of ALM for runoff modeling. In addition, ALM training is easier and more straightforward than the training of many other data driven models such as optimized SVM and it is able to identify and rank the effective input variables for the runoff modeling. According to the results of ALM simulation and its abilities and properties, it has merit to be introduced as a new modeling method for the runoff modeling.

This paper considers scheduling with jointly the deterioration and learning effects and multi-maintenance activities on a single-machine setting. We assume that the machine may have several maintenance activities to improve its production efficiency during the scheduling horizon, and the duration of each maintenance activity depends on the running time of the machine. The objectives are to determine the optimal maintenance frequencies, the optimal maintenance locations, and the optimal job schedule such that the makespan and the total completion time are minimized, respectively, when the upper bound of the maintenance frequencies on the machine is known in advance. We show that all the problems studied can be solved by polynomial time algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce an innovative incremental learner called incremental import vector machines ((IVM)-V-2). The kernel-based discriminative approach is able to deal with complex data distributions. Additionally, the learner is sparse for an efficient training and testing and has a probabilistic output. We particularly investigate the reconstructive component of import vector machines, in order to use it for robust incremental teaming. By performing incremental update steps, we are able to add and remove data samples, as well as update the current set of model parameters for incremental learning. By using various standard benchmarks, we demonstrate how (IVM)-V-2 is competitive or superior to other incremental methods. It is also shown that our approach is capable of managing concept-drifts in the data distributions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new interest towards restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) has risen due to their usefulness in greedy learning of deep neural networks. While contrastive divergence learning has been considered an efficient way to learn an RBM, it has a drawback due to a biased approximation in the learning gradient. We propose to use an advanced Monte Carlo method called parallel tempering instead, and show experimentally that it works efficiently.

AB The objective of this research is to realise structural learning within a Boltzmann machine (BM), which enables the effective solution of problems defined as mixed integer quadratic programming. Simulation results show that computation time is reduced by up to one-fifth compared to conventional BMs. The computational efficiency of the resulting double-layer BM is approximately expressed as the ratio n divided by N, where n is the number of selected units (neurons/nodes) and N is the total number of units. The double-layer BM was applied to efficiently solve a mean-variance problem using mathematical programming with two objectives: the minimisation of risk and the maximisation of expected return. Finally, the effectiveness of our method is illustrated by way of a life cycle management example. The double-layer BM was able to more effectively select results with lower computational overhead. The results also enable us to more easily understand the internal structure of the BM. Using our proposed model, decision makers are able to select the best solution based on their risk preference from the alternative solutions provided by the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Learning to rank is designed to determine a ranking for the target objects according to some rule. Specifically, the problem about learning to rank is to learn a ranking function from a training set whose data has been ranked. It is most applied to the social sciences and information retrieval. Learning to rank is a hot issue in the field of information retrieval and machine learning at present. This paper analyses the process of Ranking Support Vector machine (RSVM) from a theoretical point of view from the classification and regression respectively, and sets up the two basic mathematical models about RSVM. The general introduction about RSVM in the application, training speed and generalization ability is also given. In the end, we come to a conclusion.

AB Implicit discourse relation classification is a challenge task due to missing discourse connective. Some work directly adopted machine learning algorithms and linguistically informed features to address this task. However, one interesting solution is to automatically predict implicit discourse connective. In this paper, we present a novel two-step machine learning-based approach to implicit discourse relation classification. We first use machine learning method to automatically predict the discourse connective that can best express the implicit discourse relation. Then the predicted implicit discourse connective is used to classify the implicit discourse relation. Experiments on Penn Discourse Treebank 2.0 (PDTB) and Biomedical Discourse Relation Bank (BioDRB) show that our method performs better than the baseline system and previous work.

AB Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease results in millions of sudden deaths annually, and coronary artery disease accounts for the majority of this toll. Plaque rupture plays main role in the majority of acute coronary syndromes. Rupture has been usually associated with stress concentrations, which are determined mainly by tissue properties and plaque geometry. The aim of this study is develop a tool, using machine learning techniques to assist the clinical professionals on decisions of the vulnerability of the atheroma plaque. In practice, the main drawbacks of 3-D finite element analysis to predict the vulnerability risk are the huge main memories required and the long computation times. Therefore, it is essential to use these methods which are faster and more efficient. This paper discusses two potential applications of computational technologies, artificial neural networks and support vector machines, used to assess the role of maximum principal stress in a coronary vessel with atheroma plaque as a function of the main geometrical features in order to quantify the vulnerability risk.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; TRANSFORMERS; SUPPORT; SYSTEM
AB Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of the insulation oil of power transformers is an investigative tool to monitor their health and to detect impending failures by recognizing anomalous patterns of DGA concentrations. We handle the failure prediction problem as a simple data-mining task on DGA samples, optionally exploiting the transformer's age, nominal power and voltage, and consider two approaches: 1) binary classification and 2) regression of the time to failure. We propose a simple logarithmic transform to preprocess DGA data in order to deal with long-tail distributions of concentrations. We have reviewed and evaluated 15 standard statistical machine-learning algorithms on that task, and reported quantitative results on a small but published set of power transformers and on proprietary data from thousands of network transformers of a utility company. Our results confirm that nonlinear decision functions, such as neural networks, support vector machines with Gaussian kernels, or local linear regression can theoretically provide slightly better performance than linear classifiers or regressors. Software and part of the data are available at http://www.mirowski.info/pub/dga.

AB This is the following paper in a series on a new initiative of wireless tomography. The goal is to combine two areas: wireless communication and radio tomography. This paper primarily focuses on phase reconstruction using machine learning for wireless tomography. When only communication components instead of sophisticated equipment are exploited to perform wireless tomography, phase information of the received field is hard to obtain. Thus self-coherent tomography is proposed, which has two main steps. First, phase reconstruction is achieved using the received amplitude only data. Second, the standard radio tomographic imaging algorithms are used for data analysis. However for the real application, the effect of noise can not be ignored. In order to improve the performance of phase reconstruction with the consideration of noise, a hybrid system for wireless tomography is proposed in this paper. Meanwhile, machine learning is explored here to execute the noise reduction.

AB This paper is focused on modern approaches to machine learning, most of which are as yet used infrequently or not at all in chemoinformatics. Machine learning methods are characterized in terms of the "modes of statistical inference" and "modeling levels" nomenclature and by considering different facets of the modeling with respect to input/ouput matching, data types, models duality, and models inference. Particular attention is paid to new approaches and concepts that may provide efficient solutions of common problems in chemoinformatics: improvement of predictive performance of structure property (activity) models, generation of structures possessing desirable properties, model applicability domain, modeling of properties with functional endpoints (e.g., phase diagrams and dose response curves), and accounting for multiple molecular species (e.g., conformers or tautomers).

AB We develop a novel modeling framework for Boltzmann machines, augmenting each hidden unit with a latent transformation assignment variable which describes the selection of the transformed view of the canonical connection weights associated with the unit. This enables the inferences of the model to transform in response to transformed input data in a stable and predictable way, and avoids learning multiple features differing only with respect to the set of transformations. Extending prior work on translation equivariant (convolutional) models, we develop translation and rotation equivariant restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and deep belief nets (DBNs), and demonstrate their effectiveness in learning frequently occurring statistical structure from artificial and natural images.

ID FINITE NEWTON METHOD
AB In the last few years, due to the growing ubiquity of unlabeled data, much effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better understanding and improve the quality of classifiers exploiting unlabeled data. Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in semi-supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the original dual formulation. In particular, training a LapSVM in the primal can be efficiently performed with preconditioned conjugate gradient. We speed up training by using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or, if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. The computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced from O(n(3)) to O(kn(2)), where n is the combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples and k is empirically evaluated to be significantly smaller than n. Due to its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for dealing with large data sets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach.

AB We propose a hybrid learning system which combines two different theories of learning, namely implicit and explicit learning. They are realized by the machine learning methods of reinforcement learning and belief revision, respectively. The resulting system can be regarded as an autonomous agent which is able to learn from past experiences as well as to acquire new knowledge from its environment. We apply this agent in an object recognition task, where it learns how to recognize a 3D object despite the fact that a very similar, alternative object exists. The agent scans the viewing sphere of an object and learns how to access such a view that allows for the discrimination. We present first experiments which indicate the general applicability of the proposed hybrid learning scheme to this object recognition tasks.

   ISSUES; BOUNDS
AB Support vector machines (SVMs), with their roots in Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) and optimization methods, have become powerful tools for problem solution in machine learning. SVMs reduce most machine learning problems to optimization problems and optimization lies at the heart of SVMs. Lots of SVM algorithms involve solving not only convex problems, such as linear programming, quadratic programming, second order cone programming, semi-definite programming, but also non-convex and more general optimization problems, such as integer programming, semi-infinite programming, bi-level programming and so on. The purpose of this paper is to understand SVM from the optimization point of view, review several representative optimization models in SVMs, their applications in economics, in order to promote the research interests in both optimization-based SVMs theory and economics applications. This paper starts with summarizing and explaining the nature of SVMs. It then proceeds to discuss optimization models for SVM following three major themes. First, least squares SVM, twin SVM, AUC Maximizing SVM, and fuzzy SVM are discussed for standard problems. Second, support vector ordinal machine, semi-supervised SVM, Universum SVM, robust SVM, knowledge based SVM and multi-instance SVM are then presented for nonstandard problems. Third, we explore other important issues such as l(p)-norm SVM for feature selection, LOOSVM based on minimizing LOO error bound, probabilistic outputs for SVM, and rule extraction from SVM. At last, several applications of SVMs to financial forecasting, bankruptcy prediction, credit risk analysis are introduced.

AB This paper is focused on the automated identification of the clinical free-text records that contain useful information (e.g. symptoms, modifiers, diagnosis, etc) of a certain disease. We introduce a novel semi-supervised machine learning algorithm to address this problem, by training the set covering machine in a bootstrapping procedure. The advantage of the proposed technique is that not only can it find the documents of interest more accurately than searching based on diagnostic codes, the features it learned could also be directly used as a knowledge representation of the given topic and to assist either further machine learning algorithms or manual post-processing and analysis.

AB Peptides are routinely identified from mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiments by matching observed spectra to peptides derived from protein databases. The error rates of these identifications can be estimated by target-decoy analysis, which involves matching spectra to shuffled or reversed peptides. Besides estimating error rates, decoy searches can be used by semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to increase the number of confidently identified peptides. As for all machine learning algorithms, however, the results must be validated to avoid issues such as overfitting or biased learning, which would produce unreliable peptide identifications. Here, we discuss how the target-decoy method is employed in machine learning for shotgun proteomics, focusing on how the results can be validated by cross-validation, a frequently used validation scheme in machine learning. We also use simulated data to demonstrate the proposed cross-validation scheme's ability to detect overfitting.

AB In recent years, several methods have been proposed to combine multiple kernels instead of using a single one. These different kernels may correspond to using different notions of similarity or may be using information coming from multiple sources (different representations or different feature subsets). In trying to organize and highlight the similarities and differences between them, we give a taxonomy of and review several multiple kernel learning algorithms. We perform experiments on real data sets for better illustration and comparison of existing algorithms. We see that though there may not be large differences in terms of accuracy, there is difference between them in complexity as given by the number of stored support vectors, the sparsity of the solution as given by the number of used kernels, and training time complexity. We see that overall, using multiple kernels instead of a single one is useful and believe that combining kernels in a nonlinear or data-dependent way seems more promising than linear combination in fusing information provided by simple linear kernels, whereas linear methods are more reasonable when combining complex Gaussian kernels.

AB In this work, we present a novel framework for automatic feature selection in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The proposal, which manipulates features generated in the frequency domain by an estimate of the power spectral density of the EEG signals, is based on feature optimization (with both binary and real coding) using a state-of-the-art artificial immune network, the cob-aiNet. In order to analyze the performance of the proposed framework, two approaches are adopted: a direct use of the Davies-Bouldin index and the use of metrics associated with the operation of an extreme learning machine (ELM) in the role of a classifier. The results reveal that the proposal has the potential of improving the performance of a BCI system, and also provide elements for an analysis of the spectral content of EEG signals and of the performance of ELMs in motor imagery paradigms.

AB Q&A is a very important step of a process of learning. This paper analyses some problems in Q&A which both teachers and learners are facing in e-learning, and proposes a novel Q&A mechanism combining automatic Q&A and collaborative Q&A technologies. In detail, this paper proposes an intelligent answer machine using Semantic Words, Keywords and their respective weights to describe the feature of a question, a keywords reverse abstracting policy, and a question matching algorithm; this paper also proposes a personalized question deliver policy to other learners with high enough login frequence, low question load and in the same learning community where all learners have similar interests, and a promoting mechanism for collaborative Q&A. By this novel Q&A mechanism, this paper hopes to offer a timely response to a learner's question, and reduce the load on teachers.

AB In this paper we consider single-machine scheduling problems with an exponential sum-of-actual-processing-time-based learning effect. By the exponential sum-of-actual-processing-time-based learning effect, we mean that the processing time of a job is defined by an exponential function of the sum of the actual processing times of the already processed jobs. For the proposed learning model, we show that under certain conditions, the makespan minimization problem, the sum of the theta th (theta > 0) powers of completion times minimization problem, and some special cases of the total weighted completion time minimization problem and the maximum lateness minimization problem all remain polynomially solvable.

AB In the present article, an attempt is made to derive optimal data-driven machine learning methods for forecasting an average daily and monthly rainfall of the Fukuoka city in Japan. This comparative study is conducted concentrating on three aspects: modelling inputs, modelling methods and pre-processing techniques. A comparison between linear correlation analysis and average mutual information is made to find an optimal input technique. For the modelling of the rainfall, a novel hybrid multi-model method is proposed and compared with its constituent models. The models include the artificial neural network, multivariate adaptive regression splines, the k-nearest neighbour, and radial basis support vector regression. Each of these methods is applied to model the daily and monthly rainfall, coupled with a pre-processing technique including moving average and principal component analysis. In the first stage of the hybrid method, sub-models from each of the above methods are constructed with different parameter settings. In the second stage, the sub-models are ranked with a variable selection technique and the higher ranked models are selected based on the leave-one-out cross-validation error. The forecasting of the hybrid model is performed by the weighted combination of the finally selected models.

AB The goal of this study was to identify and differentiate the influence of multiple habitat types that span a spectrum of suitability for Hyla squirella, a widespread frog species that occurs in a broad range of habitat types. We collected microsatellite data from 675 samples representing 20 localities from the southeastern USA and used machine-learning methodologies to identify significant habitat features associated with genetic structure. In simulation, we confirm that our machine-learning algorithm can successfully identify landscape features responsible for generating between-population genetic differentiation, suggesting that it can be a useful hypothesis-generating tool for landscape genetics. In our study system, we found that H. squirella were spatially structured and models including specific habitat types (i.e. upland oak forest and urbanization) consistently explained more variation in genetic distance (median pR2 = 47.78) than spatial distance alone (median pR2 = 23.81). Moreover, we estimate the relative importance that spatial distance, upland oak and urbanized habitat have in explaining genetic structure of H. squirella. We discuss how these habitat types may mechanistically facilitate dispersal in H. squirella. This study provides empirical support for the hypothesis that habitat-use can be an informative correlate of genetic differentiation, even for species that occur in a wide range of habitats.

AB Improving accuracies of machine learning algorithms is vital in designing high performance computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems. Researches have shown that a base classifier performance might be enhanced by ensemble classification strategies. In this study, we construct rotation forest (RF) ensemble classifiers of 30 machine learning algorithms to evaluate their classification performances using Parkinson's, diabetes and heart diseases from literature.
   While making experiments, first the feature dimension of three datasets is reduced using correlation based feature selection (CFS) algorithm. Second, classification performances of 30 machine learning algorithms are calculated for three datasets. Third, 30 classifier ensembles are constructed based on RF algorithm to assess performances of respective classifiers with the same disease data. All the experiments are carried out with leave-one-out validation strategy and the performances of the 60 algorithms are evaluated using three metrics; classification accuracy (ACC), kappa error (KE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).
   Base classifiers succeeded 72.15%, 77.52% and 84.43% average accuracies for diabetes, heart and Parkinson's datasets, respectively. As for RF classifier ensembles, they produced average accuracies of 74.47%, 80.49% and 87.13% for respective diseases.
   RE, a newly proposed classifier ensemble algorithm, might be used to improve accuracy of miscellaneous machine learning algorithms to design advanced CADx systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Depth-First search; Best-first search; Heuristic function; UCB; Adaptive
   prolog
AB Prolog is a well-known logic programming language. A Prolog program is essentially a set of knowledge predicates. A query can be executed on the knowledge set by the Prolog engine, which searches and matches the query against the knowledge set automatically by conducting a depth-first search (DFS). While deterministic, DFS does not always produce the best efficiency in Prolog execution. UCT, based on UCB algorithms, is a machine learning algorithm for solving multi-stage Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems, with a good balance between exploitation and exploration. This paper introduces a UCB gauge for each of the predicates, which can be used as a heuristic measurement for selection of predicate search. This results in a best-first search strategy for Prolog execution, which is referred to as Adaptive Prolog. Adaptive Prolog enhance its execution engine by adjusting its search path to reflect current machine learning results, and as such produce better execution efficiency than traditional Prolog.

AB Learning invariant representations of environments through experience has been important area of research both in the field of machine learning as well as in computational neuroscience. In the present study, we propose a novel unsupervised method for the discovery of invariants from a single video input based on the learning of the spatio-temporal relationship of inputs. In an experiment, we tested the learning of spatio-temporal invariant features from a single video that involves rotational movements of faces of several subjects. From the results of this experiment, we demonstrate that the proposed system for the learning of invariants based on spatio-temporal continuity can be used as a compelling unsupervised method for learning invariants from an input that includes temporal information.

AB Fall prevention is a critical component of health care; falls are a common source of injury in the elderly and are associated with significant levels of mortality and morbidity. Automatically detecting falls can allow rapid response to potential emergencies; in addition, knowing the cause or manner of a fall can be beneficial for prevention studies or a more tailored emergency response. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate techniques to not only reliably detect a fall but also to automatically classify the type. We asked 15 subjects to simulate four different types of falls-left and right lateral, forward trips, and backward slips-while wearing mobile phones and previously validated, dedicated accelerometers. Nine subjects also wore the devices for ten days, to provide data for comparison with the simulated falls. We applied five machine learning classifiers to a large time-series feature set to detect falls. Support vector machines and regularized logistic regression were able to identify a fall with 98% accuracy and classify the type of fall with 99% accuracy. This work demonstrates how current machine learning approaches can simplify data collection for prevention in fall-related research as well as improve rapid response to potential injuries due to falls.

AB Various machine learning techniques have been explored for credit scoring and management, but no consistent conclusions have been drawn on which method shows the best behaviour. This paper presents an experimental analysis involving five real-world databases with several credit scoring models, including logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees, rule induction algorithms, Bayesian models, k nearest neighbours decision rule, and classifier ensembles. Particularly, we analyse the performance of this set of algorithms by means of a non-parametric statistical test and two post-hoc procedures for making pairwise comparisons.

AB The paper presents an approach for mapping of precipitation data. The main goal is to perform spatial predictions and simulations of precipitation fields using geostatistical methods (ordinary kriging, kriging with external drift) as well as machine learning algorithms (neural networks). More practically, the objective is to reproduce simultaneously both the spatial patterns and the extreme values. This objective is best reached by models integrating geostatistics and machine learning algorithms. To demonstrate how such models work, two case studies have been considered: first, a 2-day accumulation of heavy precipitation and second, a 6-day accumulation of extreme orographic precipitation. The first example is used to compare the performance of two optimization algorithms (conjugate gradients and Levenberg-Marquardt) of a neural network for the reproduction of extreme values. Hybrid models, which combine geostatistical and machine learning algorithms, are also treated in this context. The second dataset is used to analyze the contribution of radar Doppler imagery when used as external drift or as input in the models (kriging with external drift and neural networks). Model assessment is carried out by comparing independent validation errors as well as analyzing data patterns.

AB Domain Name System (DNS) provides name to address mapping services for the entire chain of Internet connectivity. Hackers exploit this fact to damage different parts of the Internet. In this paper we clarify possible Denial of Service (DoS) threats against DNS. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is introduced is the system to detect and classify different types of DoS attacks against DNS. This system consists of a statistical preprocessor and a machine learning (ML) engine. Three different types of neural network classifiers and support vector machines are evaluated in a simulated network. The results show that a backpropagation neural network engine outperforms other types of classifiers with 99% accuracy.

AB We study structural health monitoring ultrasonics experimentally, using piezoelectric transducers affixed to a steel pipe. In this paper, we apply machine learning algorithms to detect and localize changes produced by damage while differentiating from changes produced by ambient environmental and operational variations. Damage was simulated physically by a mass scatterer grease-coupled to the surface of the pipe, and benign variations were simulated by varying the internal pressure of the pipe and the ambient temperature over time. We create a library of 335 features extracted from ultrasonic signals by utilizing a variety of signal processing and machine learning techniques. Adaptive boosting algorithm is employed to select the most significant features out of the feature library. The selected features are then fed to support vector machines to determine the presence and the location of the damage. The results show that the machine learning scheme is effective at identifying principal features like shift-invariant correlation coefficients, wavelet coefficients and curve length, and provides an average accuracy of 95% for damage detection and 93% for damage localization.

AB Transductive support vector machine (TSVM) is a well-known algorithm that realizes transductive learning in the field of support vector classification. This paper constructs a bi-fuzzy progressive transductive support vector machine (BFPTSVM) algorithm by combining the proposed notation of bi-fuzzy memberships for the temporary labeled sample appeared in progressive learning process and the sample-pruning strategy, which decreases the computation complexity and store memory of algorithm. Simulation experiments show that the BFPTSVM algorithm derives better classification performance and converges rapidly with better stability compared to the other learning algorithms.

AB Surveillance Levels (SLs) are categories for medical patients (used in Brazil) that represent different types of medical recommendations. SLs are defined according to risk factors and the medical and developmental history of patients. Each SL is associated with specific educational and clinical measures. The objective of the present paper was to verify computer-aided, automatic assignment of SLs. The present paper proposes a computer-aided approach for automatic recommendation of SLs. The approach is based on the classification of information from patient electronic records. For this purpose, a software architecture composed of three layers was developed. The architecture is formed by a classification layer that includes a linguistic module and machine learning classification modules. The classification layer allows for the use of different classification methods, including the use of preprocessed, normalized language data drawn from the linguistic module. We report the verification and validation of the software architecture in a Brazilian pediatric healthcare institution. The results indicate that selection of attributes can have a great effect on the performance of the system. Nonetheless, our automatic recommendation of surveillance level can still benefit from improvements in processing procedures when the linguistic module is applied prior to classification. Results from our efforts can be applied to different types of medical systems. The results of systems supported by the framework presented in this paper may be used by healthcare and governmental institutions to improve healthcare services in terms of establishing preventive measures and alerting authorities about the possibility of an epidemic.

AB This paper describes an application of a machine-learning agent, SimStudent, as a teachable peer learner that allows a student to learn by teaching. SimStudent has been integrated into APLUS (Artificial Peer Learning environment Using SimStudent), an on-line game-like learning environment. The first classroom study was conducted in local public high schools to test the effectiveness of APLUS for learning linear algebra equations. In the study, learning by teaching (i.e., APLUS) was compared with learning by tutored-problem solving (i.e., Cognitive Tutor). The results show that the prior knowledge has a strong influence on tutor learning for students with insufficient training on the target problems, learning by teaching may have limited benefits compared to learning by tutored problem solving. It was also found that students often use inappropriate problems to tutor SimStudent that did not effectively facilitate the tutor learning.

AB The metabolic disorders may hinder an infant's normal physical or mental development during the neonatal period. The metabolic diseases can be treated by effective therapies if the diseases are discovered in the early stages. Therefore, newborn screening program is essential to prevent neonatal from these damages. In the paper, a support vector machine (SVM) based algorithm is introduced in place of cut-off value decision to evaluate the analyte elevation raw data associated with Phenylketonuria. The data were obtained from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for newborns. In addition, a combined feature selection mechanism is proposed to compare with the cut-off scheme. By adapting the mechanism, the number of suspected cases is reduced substantially; it also handles the medical resources effectively and efficiently.

AB This article presents a gait synthesis methodology for a three-legged robot that considers multi-objetives, where the designer must assign a degree of relevance of each performance measurement available (velocity, smoothness of the locomotion, maximum actuator torque and energy consumption) in the gait characteristics. To this end, the position in time of each leg actuator is described by a periodic function that is found by using a reinforcement learning technique called Learning Automata. During the training, the SimMechanics Toolbox of MATLAB/Simulink is used to simulate the robot built using the Bioloid Comprehensive Kit, an educational robot kit manufactured by Robotis. After the training fase, the solution is applied to the real robot and the response is then evaluated and compared with the simulated robot response. In the case studies, two gait synthesis were performed with different desired characteristics. It is shown that proposed solution generates a quite satisfactory gait for the real robot in both cases.

AB Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi. They have been demonstrated to cause various health problems in humans, including immunosuppression and cancer. A class of mycotoxins, aflatoxins, has been studied extensively because they have caused many deaths particularly in developing countries. Chili pepper is also prone to aflatoxin contamination during harvesting, production and storage periods. Chemical methods to detect aflatoxins are quite accurate but expensive and destructive in nature. Hyperspectral and multispectral imaging are becoming increasingly important for rapid and nondestructive testing for the presence of such contaminants. We propose a compact machine vision system based on hyperspectral imaging and machine learning for detection of aflatoxin contaminated chili peppers. We used the difference images of consecutive spectral bands along with individual band energies to classify chili peppers into aflatoxin contaminated and uncontaminated classes. Both UV and halogen illumination sources were used in the experiments. The significant bands that provide better discrimination were selected based on their neural network connection weights. Higher classification rates were achieved with fewer numbers of spectral bands. This selection scheme was compared with an information-theoretic approach and it demonstrated robust performance with higher classification accuracy.

AB Statistical learning algorithms provide a viable framework for geotechnical engineering modeling. This paper describes two statistical learning algorithms applied for site characterization modeling based on standard penetration test (SPT) data. More than 2700 field SPT values (N) have been collected from 766 boreholes spread over an area of 220 sqkm area in Bangalore. To get N corrected value (N,), N values have been corrected (Ne) for different parameters such as overburden stress, size of borehole, type of sampler, length of connecting rod, etc. In three-dimensional site characterization model, the function N-c=N-c (X, Y, Z), where X, Y and Z are the coordinates of a point corresponding to N, value, is to be approximated in which N, value at any half-space point in Bangalore can be determined. The first algorithm uses least-square support vector machine (LSSVM), which is related to a ridge regression type of support vector machine. The second algorithm uses relevance vector machine (RVM), which combines the strengths of kernel-based methods and Bayesian theory to establish the relationships between a set of input vectors and a desired output. The paper also presents the comparative study between the developed LSSVM and RVM model for site characterization. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new class of non-local p-Laplacian operators that interpolate between non-local Laplacian and infinity Laplacian. These operators are discrete analogous of the game p-laplacian operators on Euclidean spaces, and involve discrete morphological gradient on graphs. We study the Dirichlet problem associated with the new p-Laplacian equation and prove existence and uniqueness of it's solution. We also consider non-local diffusion on graphs involving these operators. Finally, we propose to use these operators as a unified framework for solution of many inverse problems in image processing and machine learning.

AB The paper presents results of our long-term study on using image processing and data mining methods in a medical imaging. Since evaluation of modern medical images is becoming increasingly complex, advanced analytical and decision support tools are involved in integration of partial diagnostic results. Such partial results, frequently obtained from tests with substantial imperfections, are integrated into ultimate diagnostic conclusion about the probability of disease for a given patient. We study various topics such as improving the predictive power of clinical tests by utilizing pre-test and post-test probabilities, texture representation, multi-resolution feature extraction, feature construction and data mining algorithms that significantly outperform medical practice. Our long-term study reveals three significant milestones. The first improvement was achieved by significantly increasing post-test diagnostic probabilities with respect to expert physicians. The second, even more significant improvement utilizes multi-resolution image parametrization. Machine learning methods in conjunction with the feature subset selection on these parameters significantly improve diagnostic performance. However, further feature construction with the principle component analysis on these features elevates results to an even higher accuracy level that represents the third milestone. With the proposed approach clinical results are significantly improved throughout the study. The most significant result of our study is improvement in the diagnostic power of the whole diagnostic process. Our compound approach aids, but does not replace, the physician's judgment and may assist in decisions on cost effectiveness of tests. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In traditional scheduling, job processing times are assumed to be known and fixed over the entire process. However, repeated processing of similar tasks improves workers' skills. In fact, scheduling with learning effects has received considerable attention recently. On the other hand, it is assumed that there is a common objective for all the jobs. In many management situations, multiple agents pursuing different objectives compete on the usage of a common processing resource. In this paper, we studied a single-machine two-agent scheduling problem with learning effects where the objective is to minimize the total tardiness of jobs from the first agent given that no tardy job is allowed for the second agent. A branch-and-bound algorithm incorporated several properties and a lower bound is developed to search for the optimal solution. In addition, two heuristic algorithms are also proposed to search for the near-optimal solutions. A computational experiment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

AB One-class and cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) are state-of-the-art machine learning methods for estimating density level sets and solving weighted classification problems, respectively. However, the solutions of these SVMs do not necessarily produce set estimates that are nested as the parameters controlling the density level or cost-asymmetry are continuously varied. Such nesting not only reflects the true sets being estimated, but is also desirable for applications requiring the simultaneous estimation of multiple sets, including clustering, anomaly detection, and ranking. We propose new quadratic programs whose solutions give rise to nested versions of one-class and cost-sensitive SVMs. Furthermore, like conventional SVMs, the solution paths in our construction are piecewise linear in the control parameters, although here the number of breakpoints is directly controlled by the user. We also describe decomposition algorithms to solve the quadratic programs. These methods are compared to conventional (non-nested) SVMs on synthetic and benchmark data sets, and are shown to exhibit more stable rankings and decreased sensitivity to parameter settings.

AB We modified an existing association rule-based classifier CPAR to improve traditional black box model based learning machine approaches on Transmembrane (TM) segment prediction. The modified classifier was improved further by combining with SVM. The experimental results indicate that this hybrid scheme offers biologically meaningful rules on TM/EM segment prediction while maintaining the performance almost as well as the SVM method.

AB In this paper, an automatic visual inspection scheme with phase identification of microdrill bits in printed circuit board (PCB) production is proposed. Different from conventional methods in which the geometric quantities of microdrill bits are measured to compare with the prior standards, the proposed method adopts a strategy of machine learning. Thus, it lowers the requirement for the enlargement of lens and the resolution of charge-coupled device; therefore, the cost of inspecting instrument can be relatively reduced. Our method mainly includes two procedures: First, the statistical shape models of microdrill bit are built to get the shape subspace, and then the phase identification is performed in the shape subspace using some pattern recognition techniques. In this paper, we compared the performance of two statistical model methods, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminate analysis, together with three classifiers, support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks, and k-nearest neighbors, respectively, for phase identification of microdrill bits. The experimental results demonstrate that using low enlargement and resolution microdrill bit images the proposed method can measure up to high inspection accuracy, and provide a conclusion that the highest identification rates are obtained by PCA-SVMs, which are higher than that of the conventional method.

AB The P300 speller is one of the BCI applications, which allows users to select letters just by thoughts. However, due to the difference of P300 in each person and with the passage of time, users are required to do machine learning every time before use (pre-training). This pre-training is a burden to users. This paper proposes an incremental learning using unknown data to reduce the training time. Consequently, this paper shows that the proposed method gives not only the reduction of the training time but also directly use of P300 speller without pre-training by using the data of last time.

AB Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders - approximately one in every 100 people worldwide are suffering from it. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most common source of information used to monitor, diagnose and manage neurological disorders related to epilepsy. Large amounts of data are produced by EEG monitoring devices, and analysis by visual inspection of long recordings of EEG in order to find traces of epilepsy is not routinely possible. Therefore, automated detection of epilepsy has been a goal of many researchers for a long time. This paper presents a novel method for automatic epileptic seizure detection. An optimized sample entropy (O-SampEn) algorithm is proposed and combined with extreme learning machine (ELM) to identify the EEG signals regarding the existence of seizure or not. To the knowledge of the authors, there exists no similar work in the literature. A public dataset was utilized for evaluating the proposed method. Results show that the proposed epilepsy detection approach achieves not only high detection accuracy but also a very fast computation speed, which demonstrates its huge potential for the real-time detection of epileptic seizures.

AB Species- and individual-specific animal calls can be used in identification as verified in playback experiments and analyses of features extracted from these signals. The use of machine-learning methods and acoustic features borrowed from human speech recognition to identify animals at the species and individual level has increased recently. To date there have been few studies comparing the performances of these methods and features used for call-type-independent species and individual identification. We compared the performance of four machine-learning classifiers in the identification of ten passerine species, and individual identification for three passerines using two acoustic features. The methods did not require us to pre-categorize the component syllables in call-type-independent species and individual identification systems. The results of our experiment indicated that support vector machines (SVM) performed best generally, regardless of which acoustic feature was used, linear predictive coefficients (LPCs) increased the recognition accuracies of hidden Markov models (HMM) greatly, and the most appropriate classifiers for LPCs and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were HMM and SVM respectively. This study will assist researchers in selecting classifiers and features to use in future species and individual recognition studies.

AB We evaluate statistical and machine learning methods for half-hourly 1-step-ahead electricity demand prediction using Australian electricity data. We show that the machine learning methods, that use autocorrelation feature selection and Backpropagation Neural Networks, Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression as prediction algorithms, outperform the statistical methods Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA and also a number of baselines. We analyse the effect of the day time on the prediction error and show that there are time intervals associated with higher and lower errors and that the prediction methods also differ in their accuracy during the different time intervals. This analysis provides the foundation for a hybrid prediction model that achieved a prediction error MAPE of 0.51%.

AB Temporal information extraction is a popular and interesting research field in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, we report our works on temporal relation identification within the TimeML framework. We worked on TempEval-2007 Task B that involves identification of relations between events and document creation time. Two different systems, one based on machine learning and the other based on handcrafted rules, are developed. The machine learning system is based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) that makes use of only some of the features available in TimeBank corpus in order to infer temporal relations. The second system is developed using a set of manually constructed handcrafted rules. Evaluation results show that the rule-based system performs better compared to the machine learning based system with the precision, recall and F-score values 75.9%, 75.9% and 75.9%, respectively under the strict evaluation scheme and 77.1%, 77.1% and 77.1%, respectively under the relaxed evaluation scheme. In contrast, CRF based system yields precision, recall and F-score values 74.1%, 73.6% and 73.8%, respectively under the strict evaluation scheme and 75.1%, 74.6% and 74.8%, respectively under the relaxed evaluation scheme.

AB Accumulating evidence suggests that reversible protein acetylation may be a major regulatory mechanism that rivals phosphorylation. With the recent cataloging of thousands of acetylation sites on hundreds of proteins comes the challenge of identifying the acetyltransferases and deacetylases that regulate acetylation levels. Sirtuins are a conserved family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases that are implicated in genome maintenance, metabolism, cell survival, and lifespan. SIRT3 is the dominant protein deacetylase in mitochondria, and emerging evidence suggests that SIRT3 may control major pathways by deacetylation of central metabolic enzymes. Here, to identify potential SIRT3 substrates, we have developed an unbiased screening strategy that involves a novel acetyl-lysine analogue (thiotrifluoroacetyl-lysine), SPOT-peptide libraries, machine learning, and kinetic validation. SPOT peptide libraries based on known and potential mitochondrial acetyl-lysine sites were screened for SIRT3 binding and then analyzed using machine learning to establish binding trends. These trends were then applied to the mitochondrial proteome as a whole to predict binding affinity of all lysine sites within human mitochondria. Machine learning prediction of SIRT3 binding correlated with steady-state kinetic k(cat)/K-m values for 24 acetyl-lysine peptides that possessed a broad range of predicted binding. Thus, SPOT peptide-binding screens and machine learning prediction provides an accurate and efficient method to evaluate sirtuin substrate specificity from a relatively small learning set. These analyses suggest potential SIRT3 substrates involved in several metabolic pathways such as the urea cycle, ATP synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation.

AB The concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in surface waters is subject to seasonal variation, as well as abrupt changes in concentration due to events. In drinking water treatment, TOC is a precursor to disinfection byproducts such as total trihalomethanes (TTHM). With the aid of an early warning system for the detection of TOC concentrations, water treatment operators could make more informed decisions and adjust the treatment processes to minimize the generation of disinfection byproducts. In this paper, a near real-time monitoring system is explored using the Integrated Data Fusion and Machine-learning (IDFM) technique to predict the spatial distribution of TOC in a lake based upon surface reflectance data from satellite imagery. Landsat 5 TM and MODIS Terra satellite imagery can be acquired free of charge, yet MODIS has coarse spatial resolution, while Landsat has a lengthy 16 day revisit time. This difficulty is solved using data fusion algorithms to fuse the fine spatial resolution of Landsat with the daily revisit time of MODIS to generate a synthetic image with both high spatial and temporal resolution. To demonstrate the capabilities of IDFM, this case study uses the fused surface reflectance band data and applied machine-learning techniques to reconstruct the spatiotemporal distribution of TOC in Harsha Lake, which serves as the source water intake for the McEwen Water Treatment Plant in Ohio. The results of this application of IDFM were analyzed using 4 statistical indices, which indicated that the Artificial Neural Network model is capable of reconstructing TOC concentrations throughout the lake.

AB Formal model verification has proven a powerful tool for verifying and validating the properties of a system. Central to this class of techniques is the construction of an accurate formal model for the system being investigated. Unfortunately, manual construction of such models can be a resource demanding process, and this shortcoming has motivated the development of algorithms for automatically learning system models from observed system behaviors. Recently, algorithms have been proposed for learning Markov decision process representations of reactive systems based on alternating sequences of input/output observations. While alleviating the problem of manually constructing a system model, the collection/generation of observed system behaviors can also prove demanding. Consequently we seek to minimize the amount of data required. In this paper we propose an algorithm for learning deterministic Markov decision processes from data by actively guiding the selection of input actions. The algorithm is empirically analyzed by learning system models of slot machines, and it is demonstrated that the proposed active learning procedure can significantly reduce the amount of data required to obtain accurate system models.

TI Integrating machine learning in ad hoc routing: A wireless adaptive

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

AB The nodes in a wireless ad hoc network act as routers in a self-configuring network without infrastructure. An application running on the nodes in the ad hoc network may require that intermediate nodes act as routers, receiving and forwarding data packets to other nodes to overcome the limitations of noise, router congestion and limited transmission power. In existing routing protocols, the 'self-configuring' aspects of network construction have generally been limited to the construction of routes that minimize the number of intermediate nodes on a route while ignoring the effects that the resulting traffic has on the overall communication capacity of the network. This paper presents a context-aware routing metric that factors the effects of environmental noise and router congestion into a single time-based metric, and further presents a new cross-layer routing protocol, called Warp-5 (Wireless Adaptive Routing Protocol, Version 5), that uses the new metric to make better routing decisions in heterogeneous network systems. Simulation results for Warp-5 are presented and compared to the existing, well-known AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector) routing protocol and the reinforcement-learning based routing protocol, Q-routing. The results show Warp-5 to be superior to shortest path routing protocols and Q-routing for preventing router congestion and packet loss due to noise. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ID DISCOVERY
AB In this chapter I discuss connections between machine learning and the philosophy of science. First I consider the relationship between the two disciplines. There is a clear analogy between hypothesis choice in science and model selection in machine learning. While this analogy has been invoked to argue that the two disciplines are essentially doing the same thing and should merge, I maintain that the disciplines are distinct but related and that there is a dynamic interaction operating between the two: a series of mutually beneficial interactions that changes over time. I will introduce some particularly fruitful interactions, in particular the consequences of automated scientific discovery for the debate on inductivism versus falsificationism in the philosophy of science, and the importance of philosophical work oil Bayesian epistemology and causality for contemporary machine learning. I will close by suggesting the locus of a possible future interaction: evidence integration.

AB This paper reports the results of a user trial with a slot machine equipped with a stereoscopic display. The main research question was to find out what kind of added value does stereoscopic 3D (S-3D) bring to slot games? After a thorough literature survey, a novel gaming platform was designed and implemented. Existing multi-game slot machine "Nova" was converted to "3DNova" by replacing the monitor with an S-3D display and converting six original games to S-3D format. To evaluate the system, several 3DNova machines were put available for players for four months. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis was carried out from statistical values, questionnaires and observations. According to the results, people find the S-3D concept interesting but the technology is not optimal yet. Young adults and adults were fascinated by the system, older people were more cautious. Especially the need to wear stereoscopic glasses provide a challenge; ultimate system would probably use autostereoscopic technology. Also the games should be designed to utilize its full power. The main contributions of this paper are lessons learned from creating an S-3D slot machine platform and novel information about human factors related to stereoscopic slot machine gaming.

AB The internationalization of a company is widely understood as the corporative strategy for growing through external markets. It usually embodies a hard process, which affects diverse activities of the value chain and impacts on the organizational structure of the company. There is not a general model for a successful international company, so the success of an internationalization procedure must be estimated based on different variables addressing the status, strategy and market characteristics of the company at hand. This paper presents a novel hybrid soft-computing approach for evaluating the internationalization success of a company based on existing past data. Specifically, we propose a hybrid algorithm composed by a grouping-based harmony search (HS) approach and an extreme learning machine (ELM) ensemble. The proposed hybrid scheme further incorporates a feature selection method, which is obtained by means of a given group in the HS encoding format, whereas the ELM ensemble renders the final accuracy metric of the model. Practical results for the proposed hybrid technique are obtained in a real application based on the exporting success of Spanish manufacturing companies, which are shown to be satisfactory in comparison with alternative state-of-the-art techniques.

Insights gained in this way are used to create constructive neural networks implementing appropriate transformations that provide simplest models of data. This is an efficient approach to meta-learning, guiding the search for best models in the space of all data transformations. It can solve problems with complex inherent logical structure that are very difficult for traditional machine learning algorithms.

AB This research aims to enable robots to learn from human teachers. Motivated by human social learning, we believe that a transparent learning process can help guide the human teacher to provide the most informative instruction. We believe active learning is an inherently transparent machine learning approach because the learner formulates queries to the oracle that reveal information about areas of uncertainty in the underlying model. In this work, we implement active learning on the Simon robot in the form of nonverbal gestures that query a human teacher about a demonstration within the context of a social dialogue. Our preliminary pilot study data show potential for transparency through active learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the teaching process. However, our data also seem to indicate possible undesirable effects from the human teacher's perspective regarding balance of the interaction. These preliminary results argue for control strategies that balance leading and following during a social learning interaction.

AB We discuss a fault diagnosis scheme for analog integrated circuits. Our approach is based on an assemblage of learning machines that are trained beforehand to guide us through diagnosis decisions. The central learning machine is a defect filter that distinguishes failing devices due to gross defects (hard faults) from failing devices due to excessive parametric deviations (soft faults). Thus, the defect filter is key in developing a unified hard/soft fault diagnosis approach. Two types of diagnosis can be carried out according to the decision of the defect filter: hard faults are diagnosed using a multi-class classifier, whereas soft faults are diagnosed using inverse regression functions. We show how this approach can be used to single out diagnostic scenarios in an RF low noise amplifier (LNA).

AB In many domains, such as Telecom, various scenarios necessitate the processing of large amounts of data using statistical and machine learning algorithms. A noticeable effort has been made to move the data management systems into MapReduce parallel processing environments, such as Hadoop, and Pig. Nevertheless, these systems lack the features of advanced machine learning and statistical analysis. Frameworks such as Mahout, on top of Hadoop, support machine learning, but their implementations are at the preliminary stage. For example, Mahout does not provide Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms and it is difficult to use. On the other hand, traditional statistical software tools, such as R, containing comprehensive statistical algorithms for advanced analysis, are widely used. But such software can only run on a single computer, and therefore it is not scalable. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution RPig, which takes the advantages of R (for machine learning and statistical analysis capabilities) and parallel data processing capabilities of Pig. The RPig framework offers a scalable, advanced data analysis solution for machine learning and statistical analysis. Analysis jobs can be easily developed with RPig script in high level languages. We describe the design, implementation and an eclipse-based RPigEditor for the RPig framework. Using application scenarios from the Telecom domain we show the usage of RPig and how the framework can significantly reduce the development effort. The results demonstrate the scalability of our framework and the simplicity of deployment for analysis jobs.

AB Ever increasingly, universities have to face the demands of their students regarding tools and methods to complete their education in preparation for the industrial environment. On the other hand, the university has to meet a Research and Development function oriented to the improvement of the competitiveness of that environment. These are two different functions that the university must unite to offer an optimum service. Hence, the university needs tools that can meet this dual function: teaching and researching. This paper proposes the concept of a "Glass Machine" as a dual purpose approach based on the adaptation of machine tools to satisfy that dual function. This concept has been applied to a machine tool by means of two machines: a turn-milling centre and a feed-drive test bench, which have been used for practices in the subjects of 4th and 5th year of Industrial Engineering, allowing at the same time the usual research activity of the High Performance Machining Team.

AB Investors may profit from either upward or downward movements in asset prices depending on whether they are long or short. To achieve immediate gains on their position they need to be able to predict the direction of short-term future price movements. The prediction of the direction of a price change is a classification problem. Customary statistical methods, such as linear logistic regression and discriminant analysis, are applied frequently to this problem. The development of more flexible methods, such as support vector machine classification, offers practitioners potentially better and more powerful solutions. This chapter applies support vector machines (SVM) to predict the direction of price changes for a small set of Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks and tests them against the predictions obtained from logistic regression analysis. SVM appear to dominate the results. The investment returns and Sharpe ratios are higher for SVM.

AB Today there is only little support for developing software that incorporates a machine learning or a data mining component. To alleviate this situation, we propose to develop programming languages for machine learning and data mining. We also argue that such languages should be declarative and should be based on constraint programming modeling principles. In this way, one could declaratively specify the problem of machine learning or data mining problem of interest in a high-level modeling language and then translate it into a constraint satisfaction or optimization problem, which could then be solved using particular solvers. These ideas are illustrated on problems of constraint-based item-set and pattern set mining.

AB Small RNAs (sRNAs) are vital components prokaryotic regulatory processes. Many sRNAs exert their function via complimentary base pairing with target mRNAs. Existing methods for computational identification of these molecules rely heavily on sequence and secondary structure conservation among known homologs. Machine learning tools, on the other hand, have already been proven to be effective de novo predictors for biomolecules; however, their utility in predicting sRNAs has been severely limited. In this work, we have utilized the sRNA sequence and putative secondary structure information to extract a set of features and tested them for several machine learning classification tools. Our results indicate that these features can be effectively used to distinguish the sRNA sequences from their decoys with very high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity as compared to existing methods. In addition, we have shown that these features can also be used for de novo prediction of sRNAs from unknown genomic background. The use of machine learning can thus provide a viable medium for accurate computational identification of sRNAs.

AB We present an evaluation of different techniques for the estimation of forces and torques measured by a single six-axis force/torque sensor placed along the kinematic chain of a humanoid robot arm. In order to retrieve the external forces and detect possible contact situations, the internal forces must be estimated. The prediction performance of an analytically derived dynamic model as well as two supervised machine learning techniques, namely Least Squares Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks, are investigated on this problem. The performance are evaluated on the normalized mean square error (NMSE) and the comparison is made with respect to the dimension of the training set, the information contained in the input space and, finally, using a Euclidean subsampling strategy.

AB A content-based mammogram retrieval system can support usual comparisons made on images by physicians, answering similarity queries over images stored in the database. The importance of searching for similar mammograms lies in the fact that physicians usually try to recall similar cases by seeking images that are pathologically similar to a given image. This paper presents a content-based mammogram retrieval system, which employs a query example to search for similar mammograms in the database. In this system the mammographic lesions are interpreted based on their medical characteristics specified in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) standards. A hierarchical similarity measurement scheme based on a distance weighting function is proposed to model user's perception and maximizes the effectiveness of each feature in a mammographic descriptor. A machine learning approach based on support vector machines and user's relevance feedback is also proposed to analyze the user's information need in order to retrieve target images more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning approach with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel function achieves the best performance among all tested ones. Furthermore, the results also show that the proposed learning approach can improve retrieval performance when applied to retrieve mammograms with similar mass and calcification lesions, respectively.

AB In metallic structures, the first and second most frequent damages incurred are generally cracks and corrosions. Correct damage classification for these two damages is important since their phases can be developed with dissimilar patterns. In this research, damage classification using the Adaboost machine learning algorithm is investigated. To accomplish this, the physical differences of the two types of damages are defined and the most appropriate excitation signal is also determined. Various time-frequency methods are examined with the sensed damage signals to obtain a suitable signal processing method for damage classification. Among the methods examined, the spectrogram is chosen since it provides reliable results for these types of damages. With these results, the damage classification is performed through the Adaboost machine learning algorithm. The training samples for the algorithm are obtained from a finite element tool and experiments are also performed to get the testing samples. The analysis results show that correct damage classification is feasible using time-frequency representations and the Adaboost machine learning algorithm.

AB In this paper, we investigate the neural network with three-dimensional parameters for applications like 3D image processing, interpretation of 3D transformations, and 3D object motion. A 3D vector represents a point in the 3D space, and an object might be represented with a set of these points. Thus, it is desirable to have a 3D vector-valued neural network, which deals with three signals as one cluster. In such a neural network, 3D signals are flowing through a network and are the unit of learning. This article also deals with a related 3D back-propagation (3D-BP) learning algorithm, which is an extension of conventional back-propagation algorithm in the single dimension. 3D-BP has an inherent ability to learn and generalize the 3D motion. The computational experiments presented in this paper evaluate the performance of considered learning machine in generalization of 3D transformations and 3D pattern recognition.

AB This article deals with a new method for on-line small signal stability assessment of power systems. A new, ball-vector-machine-based method has been used for on-line small-signal stability assessment. The proposed method has a very short training time and a small space in comparison with support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and other machine-learning-based algorithms. Also, the proposed ball-vector-machine-based algorithm has fewer support vectors and, therefore, is faster than existing algorithms. In this article, a new decision-tree-based feature-selection algorithm has also been presented. The proposed algorithm has been applied to New England 39-bus and PST 16-machine test power systems. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for on-line small-signal stability assessment of large-scale power system.

AB Classification tools including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) are employed, and their performances compared for Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) classification using live site electromagnetic induction (EMI) data. Both SVM and NN are examples of supervised machine-learning techniques, whose purpose is to label the features (extracted from the incoming data of the unknown subsurface anomalies) based on previously trained examples. In this paper a set of three features are extracted from the EMI decay curves of the physics-based intrinsic, effective dipole moment, called the total Normalized Surface Magnetic Source (NSMS). This data is first used to train both the SVM and NN models and further serves as a basis for UXO classification. These techniques are then compared to an unsupervised learning approach, based on agglomerative hierarchical clustering followed by Gaussian Mixture modeling. We found that such combination provides reduction in the amount of required training data (which is being requested solely based on the clustering results) and allows for convenient probabilistic interpretation of the classification. The classification results themselves depend on the UXO caliber, material composition and actual live UXO site's conditions. Therefore, here we report the classification results for a live UXO data set, collected at former Camp San Luis Obispo, CA. This study includes four targets-of-interest: 60-mm, 81-mm, and 4.2-in mortars and 2.36-in rockets. The classification performance between clutters and UXO is studied and the corresponding ROC curves are illustrated.

AB Machine learning and data mining have become aware that using constraints when learning patterns and rules can be very useful. To this end, a large number of special purpose systems and techniques have been developed for solving such constraint-based mining and learning problems. These techniques have, so far, been developed independently of the general purpose tools and principles of constraint programming known within the field of artificial intelligence. This paper shows that off-the-shelf constraint programming techniques can be applied to various pattern mining and rule learning problems (cf. also (De Raedt, Guns, and Nijssen 2008; Nijssen, Guns, and De Raedt 2009)). This does not only lead to methodologies that are more general and flexible, but also provides new insights into the underlying mining problems that allow us to improve the state-of-the- art in data mining. Such a combination of constraint programming and data mining raises a number of interesting new questions and challenges.

AB The proposed work presents a method for the computer-aided detection in dermoscopic images of two of the most significant patterns in the diagnosis of melanoma, the blue-white veil (an irregular, structureless area of confluent blue pigmentation with an overlying white "ground-glass" haze) and dark-red patch of pigment. The development has been made with the help of supervised machine learning techniques, in a two steps process: firstly, obtaining the conditions that must satisfy the pixels, and secondly, obtaining the features that the image of the skin lesion should have, in relation to the region and the image itself. Tested over a database of 887 images, it has been obtained a results of 89.06% correctly detected. Moreover, as a part of the proposed method itself (derived from the close relationship with the blue-white veil) has been developed a method for obtaining the pixel rules for the dark-red patch of pigment pattern ("a patch of dark red pigmentation") recognition. Tested over 80 images, it has been obtained a results of 95.14% correctly detected.

AB In the preset report, for the first time, support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian networks (BNs), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) are applied and compared on two "in-house" datasets to describe the tyrosinase inhibitory activity from the molecular structure. The data set Data I is used for the identification of tyrosinase inhibitors (TIs) including 701 active and 728 inactive compounds. Data II consists of active chemicals for potency estimation of TIs. The 2D TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as molecular descriptors. The derived models show rather encouraging results with the areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AURC) curve in the test set above 0.943 and 0.846 for the Data I and Data II, respectively. Multiple comparison tests are carried out to compare the performance of the models and reveal the improvement of machine learning (ML) techniques with respect to statistical ones (see Chemometr. Intell. Lab. Syst. 2010, 104, 249). In some cases, these ameliorations are statistically significant. The tests also demostrate that k-NN, despite being a rather simple approach, presents the best behavior in both data. The obtained results suggest that the ML-based models could help to improve the virtual screening procedures and the confluence of these different techniques can increase the practicality of data mining procedures of chemical databases for the discovery of novel TIs as possible depigmenting agents.

AB ESA's upcoming satellites Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (53) aim to ensure continuity for Landsat 5/7, SPOTS, SPOT-Vegetation and Envisat MERIS observations by providing superspectral images of high spatial and temporal resolution. S2 and S3 will deliver near real-time operational products with a high accuracy for land monitoring. This unprecedented data availability leads to an urgent need for developing robust and accurate retrieval methods. Machine learning regression algorithms may be powerful candidates for the estimation of biophysical parameters from satellite reflectance measurements because of their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting.
   By using data from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain) we have compared the utility of four state-of-the-art machine learning regression algorithms and four different S2 and S3 band settings to assess three important biophysical parameters: leaf chlorophyll content (Chl), leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The tested Sentinel configurations were: S2-10 m (4 bands), S2-20 m (8 bands), 52-60 m (10 bands) and S3-300 m (19 bands), and the tested methods were: neural networks (NN), support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR).
   GPR outperformed the other retrieval methods for the majority of tested configurations and was the only method that reached the 10% precision required by end users in the estimation of Chl. Also, although validated with an RMSE accuracy around 20%, GPR yielded optimal LAI and FVC estimates at highest S2 spatial resolution of 10 m with only four bands. In addition to high accuracy values, GPR also provided confidence intervals of the estimates and insight in relevant bands, which are key advantages over the other methods. Given all this, GPR proved to be a fast and accurate nonlinear retrieval algorithm that can be potentially implemented for operational monitoring applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we consider the single-machine scheduling problems with job-position-based and sum-of-processing-times based processing times. The real processing time of a job is a function of its position and the total processing time of the jobs that are in front of it in the sequence. The objective is to minimize the makespan, and to minimize the mean finish time. We prove that some special cases are polynomially solvable under some restrictions of the parameters. In addition, for some another special cases of minimization of the mean finish time and the makespan, we show that an optimal schedule is V-shaped with respect to job normal processing times. Then, we propose a heuristic based on the V-shaped property, and show through a computational experiment that it performs efficiently. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Industry competitiveness depends on the cost, performance, and timely delivery of the product. Thus, an accurate, rapid, and robust product cost estimation model for the entire product life cycle is essential. This research applies two machine learning methods - back-propagation neural networks (BPNs) and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) - to solve product life cycle cost estimation problems. The performance of a number of cost estimation models, statistical regression analyses, BPNs and LS-SVMs, are compared in terms of their performance. The estimation results and performance reveal that both LS-SVMs and BPNs can both provide more accurate performance than conventional models. We also make the first attempt to combine LS-SVMs and data transformation (DT) techniques to solve the outlier problem in the cost database. The cost estimation of airframe structure manufacturing was used to evaluate the feasibility of this novel combining mechanism. Finally, a more accurate, available, and generalisable cost estimation model is presented. This research can serve as a useful reference for product cost planning and control in industries.

AB Worms such as Slammer, Nimda, and Code Red I are anomalies that affect performance of the global Internet Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). BGP anomalies also include Internet Protocol (IP) prefix hijacks, miss-configurations, and electrical failures. Statistical and machine learning techniques have been recently deployed to classify and detect BGP anomalies. In this paper, we introduce new classification features and apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) models and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to design anomaly detection mechanisms. We apply these multi classification models to correctly classify test datasets and identify the correct anomaly types. The proposed models are tested with collected BGP traffic traces and are employed to successfully classify and detect various BGP anomalies.

ID REGULARIZATION
AB We propose a new approach, multi-view Laplacian support vector machines (SVMs), for semi-supervised learning under the multi-view scenario. It integrates manifold regularization and multi-view regularization into the usual formulation of SVMs and is a natural extension of SVMs from supervised learning to multi-view semi-supervised learning. The function optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is converted to an optimization in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. After providing a theoretical bound for the generalization performance of the proposed method, we further give a formulation of the empirical Rademacher complexity which affects the bound significantly. From this bound and the empirical Rademacher complexity, we can gain insights into the roles played by different regularization terms to the generalization performance. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets are presented, which validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-view Laplacian SVMs approach.

AB In this paper, a relevance vector machine based infinite decision agent ensemble learning (RVMIdeal) system is proposed for the robust credit risk analysis. In the first level of our model, we adopt soft margin boosting to overcome overfitting. In the second level, the RVM algorithm is revised for boosting so that different RVM agents can be generated from the updated instance space of the data. In the third level, the perceptron Kernel is employed in RVM to simulate infinite subagents. Our system RVMIdeal also shares some good properties, such as good generalization performance, immunity to overfitting and predicting the distance to default. According to the experimental results, our proposed system can achieve better performance in term of sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Generating stable antibodies is an important goal in the development of antibody-based drugs. Often, thermal stability is assumed predictive of overall stability. To test this, we used different internally created antibodies and first studied changes in antibody structure as a function of pH, using the dye ANS. Comparison of the pH(50) values, the midpoint of the transition from the high-pH to the low-pH conformation, allowed us for the first time to rank antibodies based on their pH stability. Next, thermal stability was probed by heating the protein in the presence of the dye Sypro Orange. A new data analysis method allowed extraction of all three antibody unfolding transitions and showed close correspondence to values obtained by differential scanning calorimetry. T-1%, the temperature at which 1% of the protein is unfolded, was also determined. Importantly, no correlations could be found between thermal stability and pH(50), suggesting that to accurately quantify antibody stability, different measures of protein stability are necessary. The experimental data were further analyzed using a machine-learning approach with a trained model that allowed the prediction of biophysical stability using primary sequence alone. The pH stability predictions proved most successful and were accurate to within pH +/- 0.2.

AB The High Performance Manufacturing Group of the Faculty of Engineering of Bilbao has a workshop fully-equipped with various machines, such as machining centers, turning centers, grinding machines and EDM machines.
   Currently, there is a higher demand of flexible structures and self learning tools in order to make easier and more reliable self learning structures. In this way, these machine tools are valid both to support research carried out by the Group and also to improve teaching lessons, both theoretically and practically.
   In this paper, the case of a five-axis milling machine was presented and analyzed. Each year, the new students are taught to design various systems of the machine and they are also encouraged to make some practical tests. This dual use of machines is very useful since it allows to carry out high level researches, as well as to train new students in theoretical and practical issues.

AB Empirical success of kernel-based learning algorithms is very much dependent on the kernel function used. Instead of using a single fixed kernel function, multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithms learn a combination of different kernel functions in order to obtain a similarity measure that better matches the underlying problem. We study multi-task learning (MTL) problems and formulate a novel MTL algorithm that trains coupled but nonidentical MKL models across the tasks. The proposed algorithm is especially useful for tasks that have different input and/or output space characteristics and is computationally very efficient. Empirical results on three data sets validate the generalization performance and the efficiency of our approach.

ID MODEL
AB One of the most promising approaches to machine translation consists in formulating the problem by means of a pattern recognition approach. By doing so, there are some tasks in which online adaptation is needed in order to adapt the system to changing scenarios. In the present work, we perform an exhaustive comparison of four online learning algorithms when combined with two adaptation strategies for the task of online adaptation in statistical machine translation. Two of these algorithms are already well-known in the pattern recognition community, such as the perceptron and passive-aggressive algorithms, but here they are thoroughly analyzed for their applicability in the statistical machine translation task. In addition, we also compare them with two novel methods, i.e., Bayesian predictive adaptation and discriminative ridge regression. In statistical machine translation, the most successful approach is based on a log-linear approximation to a posteriori distribution. According to experimental results, adapting the scaling factors of this log-linear combination of models using discriminative ridge regression or Bayesian predictive adaptation yields the best performance.

ID FAULT-DETECTION
AB The application of intelligent algorithms, in electro-mechanical diagnosis systems, is increasing in order to reach high reliability and performance ratios in critical and complex scenarios. In this context, different multidimensional intelligent diagnosis systems, based on different machine learning techniques, are presented and evaluated in an electro-mechanical actuator diagnosis scheme. The used diagnosis methodology includes the acquisition of different physical magnitudes from the system, such as machine vibrations and stator currents, to enhance the monitoring capabilities. The features calculation process is based on statistical time and frequency domains features, as well as time-frequency fault indicators. A features reduction stage is, additionally, included to compress the descriptive fault information in a reduced feature set. After, different classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Neural Network, k-Nearest Neighbors and Classification Trees are implemented. Classification ratios over inputs corresponding to previously learnt classes, and generalization capabilities with inputs corresponding to learnt classes slightly modified are evaluated in an experimental test bench to analyze the suitability of each algorithm for this kind of application.

AB The theory of machine learning in Banach space is a new research topic and has drawn much attention in recent years. The theoretical foundation of this topic is that under what conditions two sample sets can be separated in Banach space. In this paper, motivated by developing new support vector machine (SVM) in Banach space, we present a necessary and sufficient condition of separating two finite classes of samples by a hyper-plane in Banach space. We also present an attainable expression of maximal margin of the separating hyper-planes which includes some cases of the classes of infinite samples in Banach space.

DE transfer learning; ensemble learning; machine learning
AB The lack of labeled training data is a common issue in many machine learning applications. Semi-supervised learning addresses this issue by self-labeling unlabelled examples. Transfer learning tackles it from a different way: borrow labeled examples from a different but related domain (source domain) by assigning weights to those examples based on their suitability on the new domain (target domain). However, it is quite challenging to figure out the suitability. In this paper, we propose a different way for utilizing the labeled examples from source domain. That is, we use them only for labelling the unlabelled examples in the target domain. In this self-labelling, we use the idea of Tri-training. We call our new algorithm: TriTransfer. In TriTransfer, three initial classifiers are generated from the source data and the originally labeled data in the target domain, and an unlabeled example is labeled and added to the labeled data for a classifier if other two classifiers agree on its label. After an expanded labeled data set is obtained, we re-train the classifier. We repeat this process until no more change can be made. At the end, the final classifier, which is a weighted combination of the three classifiers, is output. We conduct an extensive empirical study on 34 UCI datasets, which shows that TriTransfer performs better than the state-of-art algorithms TransferBoost, Tritraining, and NaiveBayes.

AB Our previous work demonstrated the possibility of distinguishing several kinds of applications with accuracy of over 99 %. Today, most of the traffic is generated by web browsers, which provide different kinds of services based on the HTTP protocol: web browsing, file downloads, audio and voice streaming through third-party plugins, etc. This paper suggests and evaluates two approaches to distinguish various HTTP content: distributed among volunteers' machines and centralized running in the core of the network. We also assess accuracy of the global classifier for both HTTP and non-HTTP traffic. We achieved accuracy of 94 %, which supposed to be even higher in real-life usage. Finally, we provided graphical characteristics of different kinds of HTTP traffic.

DE Error minimized extreme learning machines; Support vector sequential
   feed-forward neural networks; Sequential approximations
ID ALGORITHM; ENSEMBLE
AB Recently, error minimized extreme learning machines (EM-ELMs) have been proposed as a simple and efficient approach to build single-hidden-layer feed-forward networks (SLFNs) sequentially. They add random hidden nodes one by one (or group by group) and update the output weights incrementally to minimize the sum-of-squares error in the training set. Other very similar methods that also construct SLFNs sequentially had been reported earlier with the main difference that their hidden-layer weights are a subset of the data instead of being random. These approaches are referred to as support vector sequential feed-forward neural networks (SV-SFNNs), and they are a particular case of the sequential approximation with optimal coefficients and interacting frequencies (SAOCIF) method. In this paper, it is firstly shown that EM-ELMs can also be cast as a particular case of SAOCIF. In particular, EM-ELMs can easily be extended to test some number of random candidates at each step and select the best of them, as SAOCIF does. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the cost of the computation of the optimal output-layer weights in the originally proposed EM-ELMs can be improved if it is replaced by the one included in SAOCIF. Secondly, we present the results of an experimental study on 10 benchmark classification and 10 benchmark regression data sets, comparing EM-ELMs and SV-SFNNs, that was carried out under the same conditions for the two models. Although both models have the same (efficient) computational cost, a statistically significant improvement in generalization performance of SV-SFNNs vs. EM-ELMs was found in 12 out of the 20 benchmark problems.

AB In most kernel based online learning algorithms, when an incoming instance is misclassified, it will be added into the pool of support vectors and assigned with a weight, which often remains unchanged during the rest of the learning process. This is clearly insufficient since when a new support vector is added, we generally expect the weights of the other existing support vectors to be updated in order to reflect the influence of the added support vector. In this paper, we propose a new online learning method, termed Double Updating Online Learning, or DUOL for short, that explicitly addresses this problem. Instead of only assigning a fixed weight to the misclassified example received at the current trial, the proposed online learning algorithm also tries to update the weight for one of the existing support vectors. We show that the mistake bound can be improved by the proposed online learning method. We conduct an extensive set of empirical evaluations for both binary and multi-class online learning tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is considerably more effective than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithms.

ID TEXT CLASSIFICATION; SEMANTIC KERNELS
AB The modeling of system semantics (in several ICT domains) by means of pattern analysis or relational learning is a product of latest results in statistical learning theory. For example, the modeling of natural language semantics expressed by text, images, speech in information search (e.g. Google, Yahoo,..) or DNA sequence labeling in Bioinformatics represent distinguished cases of successful use of statistical machine learning. The reason of this success is due to the ability to overcome the concrete limitations of logic/rule-based approaches to semantic modeling: although, from a knowledge engineer perspective, rules are natural methods to encode system semantics, noise, ambiguity and errors affecting dynamic systems, prevent such approached from being effective, e.g. they are not flexible enough.
   In contrast, statistical relational learning, applied to representations of system states, i.e. training examples, can produce semantic models of system behavior based on a large number attributes. As the values of the latter are automatically learned, they reflect the flexibility of statistical settings and the overall model is robust to unexpected system condition changes. Unfortunately, while attribute weight and their relations with other attributes can be automatically learned from examples, their design for representing the target object (e.g. a system state) has to be manually carry out. This requires expertise, intuition and deep knowledge about the expected system behavior. A typical difficult task is for example the conversion of structures into attribute-value representations.
   Kernel Methods are powerful techniques designed within the statistical learning theory. They can be used in learning algorithms in place of attributes, thus simplifying object representation. More specifically, kernel functions can define structural and semantic similarities between objects (e.g. states) at abstract level, replacing the similarity defined in terms of attribute overlap.
   In this chapter, we provide the basic notions of machine learning along with latest theoretical results obtained in recent years. First, we show traditional and simple machine learning algorithms based on attribute-value representations and probability notions such as the Naive Bayes and the Decision Tree classifiers. Second, we introduce the PAC learning theory and the Perceptron algorithm to provide the readers with essential concepts of modern machine learning. Finally, we use the above background to illustrate a simplified theory of Support Vector Machines, which, along with the kernel methods, are the ultimate product of the statistical learning theory.

AB Digital image processing provides powerful tools for fast and precise analysis of large image data sets in marine and geoscientific applications. Because of the increasing volume of georeferenced image and video data acquired by underwater platforms such as remotely operated vehicles, means of automatic analysis of the acquired image data are required. A new and fast-developing application is the combination of video imagery and mosaicking techniques for seafloor habitat mapping. In this article we introduce an approach to fully automatic detection and quantification of Pogonophora coverage in seafloor video mosaics from mud volcanoes. The automatic recognition is based on textural image features extracted from the raw image data and classification using machine learning techniques. Classification rates of up to 98.86% were achieved on the training data. The approach was extensively validated on a data set of more than 4000 seafloor video mosaics from the Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Scheduling with deteriorating jobs or learning effects has been widely studied recently. There are situations where both the deterioration and learning effects might exist at the same time. However, the research with the consideration of both the effects is relatively limited. Furthermore, the forms of the effects are specific functions in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a general scheduling model in the sense that the form of the function is unspecified. Under the proposed model, the actual job processing time is a general function on the processing times of the jobs already processed and its scheduled position. The optimal solutions for some single-machine problems are provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Multilingual and cross-lingual ontology matching; machine learning;
   interoperability of financial information
AB Ontology matching is a task that has attracted considerable attention in recent years. With very few exceptions, however, research in ontology matching has focused primarily on the development of monolingual matching algorithms. As more and more resources become available in more than one language, novel algorithms are required which are capable of matching ontologies which share more than one language, or ontologies which are multilingual but do not share any languages. In this paper, we discuss several approaches to learning a matching function between two ontologies using a small set of manually aligned concepts, and evaluate them on different pairs of financial accounting standards, showing that multilingual information can indeed improve the matching quality, even in cross-lingual scenarios. In addition to this, as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between multilingual and cross-lingual ontology matching, we provide precise definitions of these terms in relation to monolingual ontology matching, and quantify their effects on different matching algorithms.
